It might install spyware on the infected computer to harvest personal information or business documents, writes Rascagneres. It might also install banking Trojans to steal money or it might install any other form of harmful software that can suit the needs of the attackers. Fellow researchers have suggested that Poweliks is used in botnet structures and to generate immense revenue through ad-fraud.

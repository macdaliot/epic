0.02862275904233224 Considering that there are attackers out there actively exploiting this flaw it is certainly an important one, although at this time it appears that only the people behind Duqu know how to use it successfully.
0.032066246472849 Gauss has a lot of similarities to its malicious predecessors, and researchers are confident that it is the handiwork of the same group that wrote Flame at a minimum, and likely Duqu and Stuxnet as well.

0.0438871945977111 The Cutwail/Pushdo botnet is one of the more well-known and well-researched botnets in operation right now, and several different groups of researchers have attempted to disrupt its operations or take it down completely, with varying degrees of success.
0.00819030415397181 The post PushDo Malware Domain Generation Adaptation appeared first on Seculert Blog on Advanced Persistent Threats and Malware .
1.6156680799905843e-0 The researchers found that, like virtually all large-scale botnets, Cutwail/Pushdo in fact comprises several smaller botnets, each of which is operated by an individual customer of the overarching crew behind the operation.

0.03809075331071143 Instead of storing its files in folders in the Recycle Bin and then modifying them so the user can't read from or write to them, the new ZeroAccess version drops them into the Program Files folder AND the user's local AppData area.
0.00481286131687841 It uses the following piece of code (shown without comments) to achieve this: Now, ZeroAccess uses dynamic forking of Win32 EXE to execute code in another process's context, but with a twist.

0.0484216276160481 The ZeroAccess rootkit has been around for quite some time now, spying on infected users, hiding from installed AV solutions and attempting to terminate them, redirecting users' online searches to malicious pages, downloading additional malware, and waiting for commands from criminals..

0.02140285162960098 Not to sound the panic alarm, but it appears that I was slightly off base earlier with my comment that the Srizbi fallback C&C domains were hard coded in the sample.
0.01484810400083069 This means that it is actually Rustock which is facilitating the spreading of Srizbi, not the Exchanger service itself.
0.020405473669021 The most recent vulnerability is being exploited by an Angler competitor known as Hanjuan .
0.0161400411591380 When Microsoft went after the Rustock botnet, the company needed to seize servers that were being used by the scammers.

0.140228544495269 Hopefully the Stuxnet incident as well as recent ICS alerts will convince vendors and operators alike to allocate more resources to security and make it a central component of their infrastructure.
0.723066755847084 However, as the cyber threat becomes ever more frequent and sophisticated, the potential to compromise critical systems and cause real world damage grows – and notorious viruses such as Stuxnet and Flame have highlighted the cascading effect that an attack can have on other infrastructure sectors.
0.225619270102374 However, focus on ICS security had not been slumbering until Stuxnet hit the headlines.
0.568686102588219 Hyppönen ( left ), the widely respected chief research officer at Sweden's F-Secure, says what is often missing in this story is whether Stuxnet actually killed people.
0.332207395890671 Hyppönen was involved in the investigation on Stuxnet, and he discovered that was possible to make a reverse engineering of the detected samples to build new agents and hit new types of targets.
0.538935976546373 Hypponen highlighted a number of malware samples widely thought to have been produced by the U.S. government, namely Stuxnet and Flame , though he emphasized that government entities around the globe are currently deploying malware against other countries' politicians and even citizens.
0.0823067540335551 I can't remember which journalist or antivirus researcher first mentioned power plants (some of which certainly do run WinCC) in connection with Stuxnet.
0.1056900068317309 I have heard stuxnet labeled both sophisticated and unsophisticated.
0.4767499435766231 I have said for years that the Stuxnet story marked the beginning of a new era for the cyber security community.
0.78711018220245 I not agree this school of thought, Stuxnet is the demonstration that an agent can get out of control, out of the cage, and could attack also machines of the country of its creators, don't forget that cyberspace has no boundaries.
0.1916605465183903 Ian's FARS news agency reported the news -- far-fetched as it may sound -- that Stuxnet version 2 was discussed at a meeting between the two sides on November 24 in Vienna.
0.350576527484849 "If catastrophic damage was caused by Stuxnet, that would have been by accident rather than by purpose.
0.515961583678632 "If Gauss came after Stuxnet, it's clear the authors disliked the publicity its PLC [programmable logic controller] payload received and made an effort to hide it properly the second time.".
0.69640375194938 If it follows a similar infection vector to the original Stuxnet tho, we probably would hear of it due to the massive Windows infections that precede the attacks on the industrial systems.
0.296845491861843 If the news is confirmed the news is very concerning, Stuxnet had infected the internal network of a Russian nuclear plant, exactly in the same way it compromised the control system in Iranian nuclear facilities in Natanz .
0.137376478418229 If these reports are confirmed, they would be enough to make small changes to Stuxnet effective against systems of North Korea.
0.4539403164041717 In 2010, the Stuxnet computer worm was identified as the first-ever cyber-weapon to attack a particular industrial target.
0.747672912156683 In addition, they have attracted some of the most sophisticated (Stuxnet, Night Dragon, Flame) and damaging ( Eric Byres, CTO and vice president of engineering at Tofino Security, investigated the effectiveness of patching for protecting control systems from vulnerability exploits and malware.
0.322978728400855 In addition to fixing the LNK file vulnerability that allowed Stuxnet to infect machines when a stick was plugged in, company engineers have also reworked the autorun feature that used to automatically open a window each time a removable drive was connected.
0.0877339767076398 In addition to June 24th, the Stuxnet MS10-061 exploit stopped working on June 1st, 2011.
0.477132801317224 In addition to the computer's name and the domain name, Stuxnet has recorded the machine's IP number.
0.655867279370454 In analyzing the oldest known version of Stuxnet, researchers found the worm was in development as early as November 2005 and released in the wild two years later.

0.0713134894637469 In fact, if Obama administration officials would not have leaked the confirmation that the U.S. government (together with the Israelis) was behind Stuxnet, we probably would have never known for sure.
0.1746648518458200 In fact, in today's world where issues such as BadUSB and Stuxnet fill the headlines, a 2013 AhnLab survey found that 78% of IT professionals admit to having picked up and plugged in abandoned USB drives they just happened to find.
0.764170704081118 In fact, some experts say that Stuxnet could well have been far more effective and difficult to detect had the attackers not made a few elementary mistakes.
0.394744414195858 In fact well over 1,000 binaries have been flagged by various vendors as Stuxnet over the past few months.
0.548695516742783 In February 2011, Symantec published a new version of its W32.Stuxnet Dossier report .
0.487179525188368 In its latest 'Patch Tuesday' notice, Microsoft issued 14 security bulletins including fixes for the Freak flaw and the Stuxnet worm - which was thought to have been patched five years ago.
0.537100760000940 In my presentation, I gave an example of targeted attacks, including the ultimate targeted attack, which was Stuxnet.
0.2426269240261188 In other words, if South Korea recreates Stuxnet, there's reason to fear that it could unleash a whole new Pandora's box full of related malware.
0.060576684369779 In other words, Stuxnet and Aurora have been owning networks around the world, without ever touching them.
0.272251229601061 In our journey of THN, we have seen the cyber world growing from Defacement to most Sophisticated cyber crimes of the Decade i.e Stuxnet and Flame Malwares .

0.652467751215996 In the case of Stuxnet and DuQu, they used digitally signed components to make their malware appear to be trustworthy applications.
0.0684053047521827 In the case of Stuxnet it was hard to modify the code related to the attack against industrial SCADA control systems, but anyway the malware could be adapted to send malicious commands to an infected industrial plant that could cause serious damages.
0.1090081965962214 In the end, Stuxnet may have knocked Iran's progress towards a nuclear weapon off by five years or more - part of a program to "run the clock" on Iran.
0.511882784091066 In the more than two years that has passed since Stuxnet was discovered during the summer of 2010, the malware's complexity and goal of causing damage in the physical world has led to multiple efforts to peel back all of the layers of Stuxnet's existence.
0.793573095466620 In the past, he has been critical of both the media coverage of the Stuxnet worm and of Siemens response to revelations that software vulnerabilities and other structural weaknesses in its products contributed to the creation of Stuxnet and the success of the attack.
0.750772125571798 In their new book, Fallout: The True Story of the CIA's Secret War on Nuclear Trafficking, they posit that Stuxnet is just the latest in a years-long effort by the U.S. and its allies to prevent nuclear proliferation.
0.750377899971589 In this case, the Iranian government might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat.
0.343865423570701 In this week's Stuxnet news, ICS-CERT, a division of US-CERT pointed out web search engine Shodan can easily detect companies running Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition software.
0.0850844865840095 Incidents further back, such as the Stuxnet infection of Iran's nuclear facilities, may also foreshadow a time when governments will need even greater wherewithal to deal with advanced malware.
0.71009175944382 Included in the batch is a fix for a flaw first patched in 2010 - the very same vulnerability that led to the discovery of the infamous cyberweapon known as Stuxnet.
0.0650298103572548 Indeed the damage from Stuxnet was far in excess of whatever disruption these bank DDoS hackers have done to the United States.
0.646343975090117 Indications on the presence of a state-sponsored attack are related to the target addressed and the region where the agent has counted the greater number of infected host, let's think for example to Flame that hit mainly Middle Eastern countries with cyber espionage intents or Stuxnet that concentrated its efficacy against Iranian nuclear plants..
0.775824836587675 Inside the failed MS10-046 patch for the Stuxnet LNK vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568), disclosed by the Zero Day Initiative in March 2015.
0.288959471063748 Instead, as reported by Wired reporter Kim Zetter in 2011 , Stuxnet 1.x versions used an entirely different attack strategy that tampered with the computerized frequency converters controlling the speed at which centrifuges spun during the enrichment process.
0.725670503796086 Iran has significantly increased its attacks on Israel's infrastructure as retaliation for the Stuxnet virus in 2009, which is believed to be developed by Israel and United States which infected country's nuclear facilities.
0.1577006669756155 Iran is a privileged cyber targets and events like this are very common, I don't understand the real motivation for the use of Stuxnet like malware, a cyber threat that could hardly produce effects desired due its past.

0.34334666212690 Israeli aggression, including the Stuxnet
0.514860173962260 It also patched a serious kernel mode driver vulnerability that could enable attackers to gain root access to a machine using a malicious USB drive, a la Stuxnet.
0.571962002941021 It is also possible to follow the manual instructions given by Microsoft for the original Stuxnet vulnerability to disable the display of icons for LNK files.
0.509604026792943 It is believed to be related to Stuxnet, the computer worm developed by the U.S. and Israel to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.
0.562466999390944 It is hard to explain why a less aggressive version of Stuxnet was deployed eventually.
0.760927901931712 It is most likely that Stuxnet was intended to affect the motors that drive uranium enrichment centrifuges.
0.2168291525048653 It is notable that the first definitions that the major anti-virus firms shipped for the Stuxnet malware were on or around the same day as my story, and that this malware was first discovered one month earlier by VirusBlokada, a relatively tiny anti-virus firm in Belarus that said it found the worm on computers belonging to one its Iranian customers.
0.415836006655355 It is this nuance which made Stuxnet so sophisticated, given its ability to target highly specific industrial processes and the field devices (PLC's), which were associated with nuclear enrichment.
0.1982679345026178 It looks like North Korea's "hermit nation" status has paid off in at least one way: the US was unable to infect the systems controlling centrifuges for North Korea's nuclear program, even after using a variant of the Stuxnet virus designed specifically for Korean systems.
0.508913006440872 It originally targeted power-plant control systems as the Stuxnet worm and then appeared in more mainstream malware because it was an unpatched vulnerability with working exploit code.
0.1600100344138476 "It seems to me Equation Group are the ones with the coolest toys," Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, told Ars. "Every now and then they share them with the Stuxnet group and the Flame group, but they are originally available only to the Equation Group people. Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame."
0.515772355942926 It should be kept in mind that, in addition to affecting motors, Stuxnet included espionage functionality and collected information on STEP 7 projects found on infected systems.
0.1622500434641309 It too was attacked multiple times-once in 2009 and twice more in 2010 by all three Stuxnet variants.
0.430044914918541 "It took a nation-state or two to create Stuxnet, utilizing some of the best engineers and analysts in the world, and the community has never seen anything like that before or since, yet defeating that type of threat is what most people are concerned with," Lee said.
0.3938376445553396 "It was 20 times more sophisticated than Stuxnet," with thousands of lines of code that took a large team, ample funding and months, if not years, to develop, he said.
0.188661479030277 It was a component that didn't fit with the malware, according to Liam O Murchu, manager of North American operations for Symantec Security Technology & Response, who in February detailed Symantec's discovery of what it nicknamed "Stuxnet 0.5" that dates back to 2005, five years before later and better-known version of the malware that was discovered in 2010.
0.791156044250602 "It was actually so similar, that it made our automatic system classify it as Stuxnet.
0.0831131637440207 It was WinCC that was cracked to allow the Stuxnet attack on the Iranian centrifuges; and vulnerabilities still exist.
0.64752996706651 It's been a fair while since we've heard a mention of Stuxnet , so the potential for Stuxnet 2 is quite interesting.
0.660096775115335 It's definitively more complex than Stuxnet and Flame when it comes to the design of the platform, functionality, or flexibility," says Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab.
0.352938491959903 "It's difficult to do a destructive attack online," Coviello said. "Even the attack on Iran ( Stuxnet ) required some level of manual intervention to pull that off; you couldn't do it remotely. You don't have to have destruction to have a serious problem. If an attack is successful enough, you can have disruption with significant financial consequences that result in a loss of confidence that is out of proportion with the financial loss in question."
0.373335149365973 It's infects USB sticks with a data stealing component that exploit the LNK (CVE-2010-2568) vulnerability, the same used by Stuxnet and Flame.
0.437436004668677 It's no reach to say that there will be more Stuxnet or Flame-style attacks in the coming year.
0.467679625850424 "It's nothing like Stuxnet," he says, explaining that this is a more generalized threat as opposed to one laser-focused on one target, "but it's confirmation that all those things people have been telling you is true.
0.4193053957752709 It's thought that Pyongyang's nuclear program uses similar hardware and software to that of Iran, so the tweaks needed to make Stuxnet work in the hermit nation would not have required much time or money.
0.1390123393391563 Javadi said that the indigenous anti-virus is actually able to detect the virus such as Stuxnet and Flame and to clean up the infected computers..
0.0752439129830482 Just a short notice and heads-up to all - the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046 which deals with the LNK vulnerability originally exploited by Stuxnet is now out.
0.43513285238888 Kaspersky found a privilege escalation exploit that was used in Stuxnet being used by the Fanny worm.
0.0729958340600929 Kaspersky Lab has uncovered what appears to be one of the most sophisticated cyber-attack groups in history - in operation for at least 14 years and which even had access to some of the exploits used in the Stuxnet and Flame campaigns.
0.720543266796367 Kaspersky Lab said it was an attack on Behpajooh in March 2010 that led to Stuxnet "leaking" into the wild after it infected other organizations in Iran and then elsewhere around the world - ultimately leading to its public discovery.
0.55852749192274 Kaspersky officials first became suspicious their network might be infected in the weeks following February's Security Analyst Summit , where company researchers exposed a state-sponsored hacking operation that had ties to some of the developers of Stuxnet.

0.224788395299621 Langner also speculates that Stuxnet was not built to escape beyond Natanz's walls, yet it did, likely through contractors who worked at the plant leaving with laptops infected with Stuxnet and plugging them in at other industrial facilities where they were contracted.
0.668603674540642 Langner enumerates three types of exploits used by Stuxnet - only one category of which (Windows operating system exploits) have been closed.
0.314217365484260 Langner points a finger at the National Security Agency as the authors of Stuxnet, calling it the only logical location for its development.
0.466220705070179 Langner reiterated his ongoing concern that governments and industry are not doing enough to protect themselves against cyber-threats like Stuxnet that could be used to damage real-world infrastructure.
0.3227881412093601 Langner said that the media paid too much attention to the four, zero day Windows vulnerabilities that enabled the Stuxnet worm, but overlooked the other security holes used by the worm.
0.786451368585626 Langner said this category of vulnerability "opens the door to extremely aggressive attacks that do not have to be nearly as surgical as it (sp) was seen in Stuxnet." .
0.447433356589640 Langner told Dark Reading that the early version of Stuxnet would not have been detected if the attackers had taken more pains to cover their tracks.
0.726711658294736 Lawson concludes that whoever wrote Stuxnet likely was constrained by time and didn't think there was enough of a return to justify the investment of more time in advanced cloaking techniques.
0.181278526838698 Let us recall Stuxnet , Flame and other high-tech "weapons."
0.2172370002376028 Let's remind that according the analysis on Flame source code conducted by Kaspersky the malware is linked to Stuxnet, a version of the famous virus shared a module with the spy toolkit.
0.4972439154845408 Level of awareness and government commitment : Before the Stuxnet case, world wide security community has always underestimated the possible effect of a cyber offensive, in many cases refusing the concept of cyber weapon .
0.440446555206580 Like handwriting analysts, the Kaspersky researchers have concluded that at least some elements of both Stuxnet and Flame were created by the same hand - or hands.
0.74499989455968 Like later versions, Stuxnet 0.5 was programmed to attack only equipment containing labels found in Iran's Natanz facility, presumably to prevent malfunctions in other plants.
0.2672210832361886 Like Stuxnet and many other pieces of malware used in the last five years, Mask code was digitally signed, in this case with a valid certificate issued to a fake company called TecSystem Ltd. Such digital credentials are designed to bypass warnings delivered by Windows and other operating systems before executing programs that haven't been vouched for by credentials issued by a recognized certificate authority.
0.4546290209676764 Like Stuxnet , Shamoon and Flame , Narilam seems to primarily target Iran.
0.340138835067589 Like Stuxnet, the threat uses a driver file signed with a legitimate digital certificate, in this case issued by Taiwan-based C-Media Electronics, according to F-Secure.
0.4285238645273743 lnk") was being exploited by highly targeted malicious software called "Stuxnet".
0.2065313852912907 Looking at the financial and R&D investment required and combining this with the fact that there's no obvious money-making mechanism within Stuxnet, that leaves only two possibilities: a terror group or a nation-state.
0.753005384154548 Luis - One of the main stories to emerge this year in the world of security has been Stuxnet, malware with unique characteristics, such as the inclusion of several 0-day exploits, or the fact that it targets certain SIEMENS systems used in nuclear power stations.
0.3793262736661282 Malicious Web sites sprung up to capitalize on everything from the World Cup to the Stuxnet worm, while reports noted SEO campaigns pushing traffic to fake search engines and malicious Android mobile applications.
0.625981974893190 Malware authors have been using this technique for several years and it has been seen in a number of high-level attacks, including Stuxnet .
0.0759074414355828 Many suspect Stuxnet was the work of Israeli intelligence.
0.4387150881987885 "Many would certainly disagree with me, but I do consider Stuxnet an APT. It's not really an APT by the classic definition pushed by many security pundits, but it's definitely an advanced attack that required the use by the adversary of multiple tactics and intelligence sources, and it's specifically targeted, so it needs to be treated with the same sort of defensive approach and cyberdoctrine as an APT," he says.
0.3488863068457147 Mark James, technical director of ESET UK, points to Stuxnet as a significant milestone in malware development, as it transitions from its data-stealing origins to more intricate deployments.
0.457458360097045 "Maybe it's a side effect of the encrypted payload that no one will be able to copy and paste the code like they could with Stuxnet.
0.2370664039835560 Microsoft Addressed FREAK & Stuxnet Vulnerabilities.
0.588783948211239 Microsoft also patched the last of the zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by the infamous Stuxnet computer worm.
0.2363507704030697 Microsoft's disclosure follows Friday's revelation that the George W. Bush and Obama administrations developed and deployed Stuxnet, the highly advanced software used to set back the Iranian nuclear program by sabotaging uranium centrifuges at Iran's Natanz refining facility.

0.438550717379511 More importantly, it's grossly premature to compare these attacks to Stuxnet , the highly sophisticated malware the US and Israel designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program , or to declare the spate of attacks " Financial Armageddon ."
0.458535973160146 More than 60 percent had replied (54 private, 47 public, 12 federal) to the survey, which asked the electric utilities a range of questions specific to compliance with standards such as FERC's Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standard, background checks, contingency plans for geomagnetic storms, whether the entity had accounted for all its assets, and even questions particular to the Aurora and Stuxnet attacks .
0.255424130090234 More typical, they say, are experiences of Dillon Beresford, who last year uncovered a slew of vulnerabilities in the same Siemens PLCs targeted by the Stuxnet worm .
0.31651663560525 Most AV companies had Stuxnet-specific detection by now, of course.
0.1494511003318670 Most notable examples include the Stuxnet , Flame , and Red October malware campaigns.
0.615229789456133 "Most utilities did not indicate how many of the voluntary cybersecurity measures related to Stuxnet, Aurora and remote access threat they have implemented.
0.636904851374841 Motivated by economic and political aims, some of the most advanced cyber attacks are designed to steal information (or, like Stuxnet, sabotage critical infrastructure) and evade detection.
0.258955627730973 Mozilla has gone a step further , asking all of the Firefox CAs audit their security systems, and at least one researcher has made the argument that the attack on DigiNotar may end up being bigger than Stuxnet .
0.299522372187070 Much has been written about Stuxnet in the last six months, with researchers settling on centrifuges used for uranium enrichment fairly early in the analysis of the worm.
0.0674929204727058 "Much has been written about the failure of Stuxnet to destroy a substantial number of centrifuges, or to significantly reduce Iran's LEU production. While that is undisputable, it doesn't appear that this was the attackers' intention," he pointed out. "If catastrophic damage was caused by Stuxnet, that would have been by accident rather than by purpose. The attackers were in a position where they could have broken the victim's neck, but they chose continuous periodical choking instead."
0.2464018246850587 Much of the earlier controversy about the origin and targeting of Stuxnet derived from uncertainty about exactly what its code was meant to do.
0.405243692376026 Naked Security writer Paul Ducklin did try to temper the hysteria at the time in his article, Stuxnet?
0.585796701234678 Namely, malicious attackers are more likely to make the process control systems "misbehave" while remaining operational -- much like Stuxnet aimed to do.

0.752937464419468 Nate Lawson, a cryptographer and expert on the security of embedded systems, said in a blog post Monday that the Stuxnet authors were very naive in the methods they used to cloak the payload and target of the malware.
0.520908459138831 Neda was attacked only once, in July 2009, and Stuxnet never left that organization, according to the infection logs available to us.
0.1835186186901475 New and important evidence found in the sophisticated "Stuxnet" malware targeting industrial control systems provides strong hints that the code was designed to sabotage nuclear plants, and that it employs a subtle sabotage strategy that involves briefly speeding up and slowing down physical machinery at a plant over a span of weeks.

0.2904981157140731 Noting that Symantec in early 2011 had established that Stuxnet, widely considered the first cyber weapon, was distributed through five organizations, Kaspersky researchers said they combed through 2,000 files collected over two years to "identify the organizations that were the first victims of the worm's different variants in 2009 and 2010.".
0.684789438283725 Noting the history of Tocy.a and its initial designation as a Stuxnet variant, the researchers probed deeper into why the companies artificial intelligence saw the two pieces of malicious code as so similar to each other, but not to other samples from Kaspersky's massive library of malware.
0.650462356475817 Now more and more attacks are becoming visible and reported (e.g. Stuxnet like 'Havex' malware strikes European SCADA Systems - June 2014) and whether they are a terrorist attack such as the data destruction attacks on Saudi Aramco and on Qatar's RasGas gas company in 2012 or unintentional (the vast majority of reported cyber incidents are 'accidental in nature' as reported by the Repository of Industrial security incidents, 2011), billions of dollars are lost every year because of them.
0.0634007881588638 Now, not only was it back with updated Stuxnet-derived malware that spied on Iran, it was also escalating its campaign with a brazen strike on Kaspersky.
0.469149973094307 Now, with attacks like Stuxnet proof of the risk, the big question is: How will industry respond?
0.314187604408618 "NSM would have caught" Stuxnet, says Sistrunk, senior consultant with Mandiant's ICS practice.
0.311921584582779 Obama officials are taking a significant political gamble by admitting to creating Stuxnet.
0.796981648687788 O'Connell is particularly concerned about the use of Stuxnet, the virus that disrupted operations at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility, now believed to have been a US/Israeli project: "I am also concerned about how the Chinese are using the internet for military advantage," she warns.
0.699453066312126 Of the remaining three attacks, one was exploited by Stuxnet and another was exploited by Conficker, the virulent worm discovered in 2008 that has infected millions of computers (and reportedly continues to do so ).
0.469911638787127 Officials have yet to determine whether the virus is a prank or was generated by Iran's cyberwarfare program, which had been rapidly expanded since Tehran's nuclear program was hit by the Stuxnet virus in 2010.
0.71110686081796 O'Murchu said there's no way of knowing if Stuxnet 0.5 ever carried out the highly advanced attack on the Siemens 417 controllers inside Natanz.
0.1545891249816221 On June 1, the New York Times reported that President Obama, since the early months of his presidency, ordered increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks on Iranian computer systems to cripple nuclear enrichment centrifuges as part of a major expansion of America's first persistent use of cyberweapons [see Report: Obama Ordered Stuxnet Assault ].

0.57045394114473 On the other hand, it may simply mean that the group was familiar enough with the modus operandi characteristic of SCADA sites to gamble on the likelihood that Stuxnet would hit enough poorly-defended, poorly-patched and poorly- regulated PLCs to gain them the information and control they wanted.
0.1558716519797789 On Tuesday, HP published a blog post on Microsoft's first "failed" Stuxnet fix, MS10-046, the same day the tech giant released MS15-020 , a critical patch that would thwart similar exploitation.

0.0920400054711069 One example is that cyberattacks on infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet attacks on Iranian nuclear fuel processing machinery, can cause physical damage.
0.4000728239893066 One example of the difficulty of keeping air-gapped environments secure involved the nuclear enrichment centrifuges at Iran's secure Natanz facility, which were reportedly crippled by the Stuxnet virus despite the centrifuges being connected only to an air-gapped network.
0.6686426688380 One of his most alarming statements, and one which has been discussed thoroughly by Kaspersky Lab researchers and speakers , was "Stuxnet is the rubicon of our future".

0.517384006371782 One of those apparent links lie in similarities between the Fanny worm, which has been used by the Equation group since at least 2008, and the Stuxnet worm, which according to multiple news articles and books that cite unnamed U.S. government sources, has been developed by the NSA and Israel's intelligence services.
0.229138407389638 One precedent is November 2010's attack on Iran's centrifuges, believed to have originated from a joint U.S. and Israel campaign dubbed Stuxnet .
0.2777709283537479 "Operation Myrtus required one or two geniuses to design Stuxnet," he warns. "Understanding and copying the design can be achieved by average engineers. Even worse, the design AND PRODUCTION process can be packaged into a software tool , enabling immoral idiots and geniuses alike to configure highly aggressive cyber weapons."
0.129328604011021 Operators at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility might well have caught Stuxnet before it spread and sabotaged operations at the plant if they had been watching the wires for anomalous network traffic, a pair of ICS/SCADA experts say.
0.395294747327553 Or at least they wouldn't have seen this, if information about Stuxnet hadn't been released last July.
0.454595413994551 Others, notably researchers at Kaspersky Lab, have suggested that both Flame and Stuxnet may be of a similar origin, even though they are separate programs.

0.299150371095849 Since Stuxnet, plenty of attention has been focused on the security of SCADA and industrial control systems.
0.1643976926212833 Since the discovery of Stuxnet the ICS/SCADA community has come under intense scrutiny from the security industry.
0.67174572065382 Since there is no defense they are often thought to be used primarily against high profile, high value targets (such as the zero-days used against Google and others in the Aurora attacks, the four zero-days used in the Stuxnet attacks on Iran, and the zero-day used in the RSA SecurID attack).
0.72914304622329 So does Stuxnet infect these Vacon and Fararo Paya drives?
0.512383724795420 So far in our series about Stuxnet we've focussed on the main issue: the threat posed by the zero-day vulnerability in the processing of LNK files, and the fact that cybercriminals have somehow got their hands on digital certificates.
0.630948510798865 So far, the only software-based attack that has been attributed to the US (though never officially acknowledged by the US government) has been the Stuxnet virus , which was reportedly codeveloped with Israeli intelligence to disable production equipment in an Iranian nuclear facility.

0.1753919679875779 Some of this attention is rightly due to the attack's sophistication, but even more is due to breathless speculation about "cyber-warfare", the alleged links to Israel and Iran, and speculation about the foreign policy effects of Stuxnet.
0.2390146237559537 Some of those voluntary recommendations are specific to attacks such as Stuxnet, while others are general in nature to remote attacks.

0.788051172324100 The Stuxnet malware was considered a harbinger of a new era of state-sponsored attacks on control systems, after it infected the Natanz uranium enrichment complex in Iran and later spread through the Internet other organizations.
0.678706721634470 The Stuxnet operation that reportedly damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuges reinforced the point, he adds.
0.303275330616868 The Stuxnet virus was likely to be one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform.
0.1801592107502639 The Stuxnet worm and the Flame malware-both of which were reportedly developed by the US and Israel to attack and spy on critical systems in Iran-relied on USB drives to propagate attack code and to ferry intercepted communications over air-gapped networks.

0.4286403155713550 The Stuxnet worm, for example, targeted five separate zero-day flaws in Microsoft's Windows operating system.
0.432226135628987 The Stuxnet worm, which attacked S7 model PLCs by Siemens loaded ladder logic created by the Worm's authors to replace the existing logic on the S7 PLCs, which was used to control centrifuges for enriching uranium.
0.562971457910556 The Stuxnet worm , which researchers agree is the most sophisticated cyber attack the public has ever witnessed, is pure James Bond material.
0.545921294854920 "The success of the Stuxnet virus and other targeted forms of cyberattack have shown hackers the value of such an approach," Steinberg adds.
0.58029223463121 The target is there, and I think with the press around Stuxnet and a lot of the independent research that has started to bubble up around control system vulnerability since then, it's getting attention from the cyber security community and also from the hacking communities.
0.3974297815710824 The term "critical infrastructure" has earned its spot on the board of our ongoing game of cyber bingo-right next to "Digital Pearl Harbor," "Cyber 9/11," "SCADA" and "Stuxnet.".
0.345715152122647 "[The United States has] shown that they work, that they're cheap, and they are deniable," he told Ars on Friday, pointing out that one of Stuxnet's main advantages was that even years after its deployment, it still had plausible deniability by American officials.
0.2247273200215492 "The United States tried to deploy a version of the Stuxnet computer virus to attack North Korea's nuclear weapons program five years ago but ultimately failed, according to people familiar with the covert campaign.
0.526632193443948 The US and Israel are widely believed to be behind the Stuxnet Trojan in 2010, which took aim at Iran's nuclear program by invading and compromising a uranium enrichment facility at Nantanz, shutting down centrifuges .
0.506586754912693 The U.S. are one of the most advanced country under cyber warfare perspective, we have read a lot on its capabilities and its offensive power, to remark some sample we can remind the plan-X project and the development of the cyber weapon Stuxnet .
0.682032539219583 The vulnerabilities in the Siemens products - which were also a target of the attackers responsible for the Stuxnet worm - were disclosed to the company and ICS-CERT by Beresford in May.

0.600012899937257 There are genuinely new and advanced elements to Stuxnet and Flame type attacks.
0.768470675297359 There are numerous cases in the news in which malware authors have used digital certificates to sign malicious code, including the cyber weapon Stuxnet , the Winnti gang and the more recent Darkhotel APT.
0.258769048443575 There is no information on whether the zero-days in Stuxnet were discovered or bought, but nevertheless ACLU policy analyst Christopher Soghoian blames Stuxnet for the success of companies like Vupen and Revuln.
0.757784273968310 There really isn't anything funny or entertaining about the Stuxnet attack.
0.732989703235330 Therefore I am not surprised by a 2010 CVE that Stuxnet is using, is still viable," says Barry Sheitman, director of security strategy at Imperva.
0.69492555180092 There's a couple of new developments in the Stuxnet rootkit case.
0.4953154632290721 There's no doubt that Stuxnet was a sophisticated attack.
0.4882092345265930 These are the groups responsible for the majority of the attacks such as Flame , Stuxnet , Red October and while those attacks sometimes are conflated with run-of-the-mill cybercrime operations designed to steal credit card numbers.
0.1332070358789335 "These guys know the centrifuges better than the Iranians," Langner said of the Stuxnet authors.

0.508831611213446 This, after the country's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was hit by Stuxnet and Iran's oil ministry was compromised by the Flame virus in April.
0.3269344439068150 This chapter provides information on some intriguing facts related to Stuxnet, such as timestamps of its binaries, and information on compiler versions which might be useful in analysis of the malware.
0.776834147178189 This is not the first effort to uncover Stuxnet's first targets; researchers at Symantec pinned down that Stuxnet was distributed from five organizations based on data collected which showed that Stuxnet saves its victims' system name, Windows domain and IP address in an internal log.
0.4618342652828474 "This is the end of plausible deniability on Stuxnet," said Chris Bronk, a former State Department official, who is now a research fellow at Rice University. "Cyber is a dangerous place to play. This makes me very nervous that we don't understand the entire set of consequences of releasing malware into the wild."
0.449702142243853 This particular version was subjected to the most detailed analysis by anti-malware companies.</p> Shortly afterwards, when news of Stuxnet had already become widespread, files related to its June 2009 incarnation were detected.
0.1139651957967305 This persistence on the part of the Stuxnet creators may indicate that they regarded Foolad Technic Engineering Co .

0.2192621769708317 This week U.S. officials warned that going forward a new variant of Stuxnet could take aim toward "broader installations" of programmable equipment in control systems.
0.4051822821167476 This will be not only as a result of "whistle blowing" revelations, but also due to the fallout from major risk scenarios playing out on many levels, affecting countries (Stuxnet virus) and businesses (the Target breach of credit and debit card data from as many as 40 million customers), not to mention the theft of $450 million of Bitcoins from the Mt. Gox exchange (which filed for bankruptcy as a result).
0.2941958646081026 Those same centrifuges, we now known, were the primary target of the Stuxnet worm, which is believed to have disabled a good part of Iran's nuclear enrichment operation and set the country's progress towards a bomb back by years.
0.660331327865402 Though high-profile APTs like the highly sophisticated Stuxnet and Flame malware appear to target governments and political groups, other APTs are utilized for corporate espionage.
0.387524441173270 Though some have recently argued that criminal malware is more advanced than some suspect, Stuxnet-a state sponsored threat-was vastly superior than any previously seen malware.
0.338241643597475 Threatpost's exclusive interview with Ralph Langner continues, as our conversation shifts from the legacy of the Stuxnet worm to larger issues facing the critical infrastructure sector including mounting attacks, tensions between vendors and security researchers over responsible disclosure, and what's needed to secure critical infrastructure and industrial control systems.
0.508041183172626 Thus, Stuxnet isn't just a rootkit that hides itself on Windows, but is the first publicly known rootkit that is able to hide injected code located on a PLC.
0.39552574569555 TMP extracts from its section with ".stub" name another component - the main dynamic link library of Stuxnet - then loads it and calls exported function number 15.
0.1073345588853159 To perform this trick, Stuxnet loads a specially crafted keyboard layout file, making it possible to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
0.399615241028594 "To put this in perspective, this is much scarier than Conficker , much scarier than Stuxnet .
0.4867112733651375 Today social media are spreading a shocking news, authors of Stuxnet virus that hit Iranian nuclear program in 2010 according a new research proposed by Symantec security company started in 2005 and contrary to successive instance of the malware he was designed to manipulate the nuclear facility's gas valves.
0.634868239795429 Today's bumper crop of updates for Windows and other Microsoft products doesn't just fix a new version of the Stuxnet shortcut attack .
0.4107923430123775 Toward the end of last week, a number of industry colleagues pointed me in the direction of some emerging news stories that cited the purported research of John Bumgarner of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit in Washington, D.C. The numerous articles covering his research suggest that the Conficker worm was unleashed by the perpetrators of Stuxnet in order to provide an initial entry vector onto Iranian systems located at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment plant, in addition to providing a smoke screen designed to "mask" the real nature of the operation.

0.1545559008207252 Until now, most of the focus has been on the LNK/PIF vulnerability which Stuxnet exploits in order to spread via removable storage media and networks.
0.1313944222479885 "Until recently we only knew that the Stuxnet developers had access to the resources of Flamer," Thakur said. "However, the recent developments we released this week confirmed our suspicions that the Stuxnet and Flamer developers are indeed related. They're either part of the same team of developers, or they're part of separate teams, but operating within the same organization."
0.698795430604848 UPDATE: Why Stuxnet-Like Attacks Aren't Going Away.
0.077482678416866 US and Israel are widely believed to be behind the Stuxnet

0.658005170726987 Very few pieces of malware have garnered the same kind of worldwide attention as Stuxnet - the computer worm used as a cyber weapon to attack Iran's uranium enrichment facility in Natanz.
0.4670248959275138 Vulnerability exploited by Stuxnet still a threat.
0.693049612073518 Way more detail, and much more sobering to see that this group of malware goes all the way back to 2001, and includes code to map disconnected networks (using USB key C&C like Stuxnet did), as well as the disk firmware facet that's everyone's headline today.
0.613077658720561 We all believe the NSA created Stuxnet, so any confirmation of this won't surprise us.
0.1812628897780742 We also present some information on Stuxnet configuration data and its remote communication protocol with C&C servers.
0.777966426381596 We are quite excited about the book which includes new and previously undisclosed information about Stuxnet.
0.578035786701667 We blogged about what we found while we were investigating the malware; our Stuxnet series may have come to an end, but that doesn't mean we've stopped our research.
0.3346928939065194 We do this by comparing two outstanding examples of these two species of attack: Aurora and Stuxnet.
0.0951243478301373 We have a clear idea of the possible effects that a cyber weapon like Stuxnet could have on the critical infrastructure of a Western country.
0.1210107508312527 We have already seen several attacks targeted at certificates as well as specifically at software developers: \u25cf The Stuxnet worm has made use of digital certificates stolen from Chinese hardware manufacturers JMicron Technology Corp. and Realtek Semiconductor Corp. in order to install code onto computers it infected 31, 32, 33.
0.30314201581446 We have compared the two exploit implementations in Conficker and Stuxnet and found that the shell codes that have been used are different.
0.597315724866162 We have now obtained an earlier version of Stuxnet that contains the fully operational 417 PLC device attack code."
0.264725563766878 "We have seen some vulnerabilities go back to 2009-2010, and I suspect that we can find even older examples. Therefore I am not surprised by a 2010 CVE that Stuxnet is using, is still viable," says Barry Sheitman, director of security strategy at Imperva.
0.442441087549879 "We know now that Stuxnet and Flame remained hidden in their target networks for years - by the time worms like these do damage or steal trade secrets, it is too late to defend against them.".
0.522180988736404 We know that the authors of Stuxnet had intimate, insider-level knowledge of and likely physical access to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
0.769931585069184 "We were amazed when Stuxnet used four zero-days, but this group has been able to discover eight zero-days.

0.357487830700518 Weighing the risk and reward involved with the scenario, using a cyberattack against the Iranian nuclear facilities with Stuxnet seems like an easy decision, though the potential dark side of the decision -- other nation-states using cyberweapons in retaliation -- has been mentioned by the likes of retired USAF general Michael Hayden and other prominent figures.
0.420517806149152 What I essentially demonstrated was that while much of Stuxnet was highly sophisticated, it had several components that, unlike Conficker, were really poorly written.
0.328946077258634 What they're going to do with that information, potentially, is to create the new Stuxnet.".
0.38719122102227 "What we can conclude from this is that Stuxnet coders had access to Flamer source code, and they were originally using the Flamer source code for the Stuxnet project," said Liam O'Murchu, manager of operations for Symantec Security Response. "With version 0.5 of Stuxnet, we can say that the developers had access to the exact same code. They were not just using shared components. They were using the exact same code to build the projects. And then, at some point, the development [of Stuxnet and Flame] went in two different directions."
0.0501875873562683 What's more, use of a USB stick to infect an array of computer platforms at the BIOS level rivals the payload delivery system found in the state-sponsored Stuxnet worm unleashed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program .
0.639735986303750 When I heard about the discovery in respect to (Stuxnet variant) Tilded , I would say I was by no means surprised.
0.2010222791809390 When it came to actually carrying out Stuxnet's most insidious attack - changing the output of the S7 PLCs from the management software, the worm's authors didn't need to leverage a sophisticated hack.
0.50632317147123 When ready, Stuxnet was introduced to Natanz, perhaps by a double agent.
0.0762478305827627 When Stuxnet happened, there was a lot of talk about how it had to be an insider, because a hacker can't just buy a control system and find the vulnerabilities and backdoors in order to build these types of attacks.
0.0685943016483648 When Stuxnet was made public in June 2010, a New York Times article contended that the worm was a creation of the United States and Israel to undermine Iran's nuclear program.
0.549872699685793 When tracking the chain of Stuxnet propagation, one of the group's branch organizations raises special interest: "Allegedly the controlling entity of Nedaye Micron Electronic Company in Tehran, Iran and Neda Overseas Electronics LLC in Dubai, UAE; provides services in industrial automation for power plants, the cement industry, and the oil, gas and petrochemical sector; established in the mid 1980s under the name NEDA Computer Products Incorporated as a fully private joint stock company" .
0.2072658472983435 When you inspect a flash USB drive infected with the Stuxnet worm you can expect to find 6 files there as on the following screenshot: Figure 3.10 - The Worm's Files on a USB Flash Drive Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; Copy of Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; ~WTR4141.
0.4211672275799922 Whereas Sanger's book focused on the US foreign policy implications of offensive cyber warfare using government insiders as the main source, Zetter's book fills in the technical story behind the attacks by interviewing everybody in the public space who was involved in unraveling the Stuxnet mystery.
0.4158224465598666 Which makes it possible to create a timeline of how Stuxnet was spreading.
0.445638771450795 While many of the Windows based vulnerabilities used by the worm have been fixed, other Stuxnet vulnerabilities "cannot be patched" he says , referring to problems that are inherent to the way SCADA and industrial control systems are designed and deployed.
0.1506259637990703 While members agreed the country poses a significant threat, Healey reminded them that U.S. government actions, including the unleashing of Stuxnet , likely has prompted attacks from that country, which may include DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions.
0.341260788147611 While modifying Stuxnet is obviously not easy, it is easier than creating the same functionality from scratch.
0.793050067696953 While most Stuxnet origin theories claim the malware to be written by Israel or US government, there are other theories as well.
0.480040691315546 While rumors of cyber-attacks were circulated about both, Flame was actually not a patch on the sophistication of Stuxnet in terms of malware authoring and in particular, the techniques used in the payload were not very impressive.
0.225053626538365 While Stuxnet is doing malicious modifications to the system, it uses a man-in-the-middle attack to fool the operators into thinking everything is normal.
0.2319550800855090 While Stuxnet was a very real thing and countries all over the world have increasingly impressive offensive capability and aren't shy about stating publicly that they are building further capability every day, there are also instances where its been shown that nation states aren't always to blame.
0.515775787336 While the AV companies all gave talks around the world dissecting the recent publicly discovered attacks like Stuxnet or Flame, most glossed over the simple fact that none of them discovered the virus till after it had done it's work.
0.567648984340385 While the intended target of Stuxnet appears to be the manipulation of Siemens PLCs, Weiss said Stuxnet could just have easy been designed to attack PLCs made by other SCADA manufacturers.
0.407399662489845 While there are some modifications, initial analysis indicates that this new driver is very similar to the first set of Stuxnet samples we've seen, with the same basic functions and approach.

0.146227790066514 Windows pcs remained vulnerable to Stuxnet-like LNK attacks after 2010 patch.
0.532919328610149 With a news crew from the weekly news program 60 Minutes on hand to film his presentation, Langner walked attendees through the process he and others used to reverse engineer and decompile the worm's code to yield the raw source code - the computer instructions that governed Stuxnet's actions.
0.506212648485885 With Stuxnet, Flame and APTs, we've given our real and imagined adversaries advanced powers of hacking and information dominance.
0.401016428987837 With the advent of Stuxnet, Aurora, Wikileaks and the ensuing slew of DDoS attacks, and high profile government and private sector data breaches, it seems as though 2010 was the year that finally made cybersecurity an unavoidable topic, and perhaps proved that the US is reliant upon yet incapable of securing certain networks that make up our digital infrastructure.

0.625062492386638 There was a huge leap in the number of circulating viruses as well, and is attributed to basically two virus families: Xpiro and Sality, says Luis Corrons, the technical director for PandaLabs.
0.55834676649008 This increase is mainly down to two particular virus families: Sality and Xpiro.

0.265363177837078 As revealed by a Kaspersky Lab report in August 2014, exploitation of the original CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability remained widespread even after the Microsoft patch in 2010, primarily because the exploit was integrated in more common threats like the Sality worm.
0.134309875638021 By using the HIPS runtime analysis feature of SAV as advised on the Sophos website the functionality of W32/Sality-AM will be significantly reduced and users will be better placed to diagnose any issues and submit files to SophosLabs for analysis.
0.731048294067753 However the bad guys really need to check their own computers, as the Trojan has itself been infected with the file-infecting virus W32/Sality-AM .
0.1391356116140135 I'd say it's unlikely this is a deliberate measure, as we've seen uninfected variants of this phishing Trojan in the past (which we detect as Mal/RarHosts-A ), and anyway the Sality doesn't so much hide the Trojan as paint it in bright colours, making it even easier to spot and to block.

0.375844197844286 Sality virus, Kido worm and the CVE-2010-2568 exploit are legacy attacks which were used to infect millions of machines worldwide, they are still widespread because they can easily infect new machines or they are publicly available for the criminals to use, which explains success rates if a device is not protected.
0.684498008995688 Testing in the lab proved that new runtime HIPS developments are still performing well against these threats and several behaviours are detected and prevented when W32/Sality-AM is running.

0.0626214727575117 Like CTB-Locker, CryptoWall doesn't take the traditional easy approach of using the legitimate Tor-executable obtained from the project's official website, but instead uses it's own obfuscated version of Tor.

0.2795760468050537 The compromised websites hosting CTB-Locker ransomware are also being used for PayPal phishing.
0.1834699727483891 The ransomware threat known as CTB-Locker (aka Critroni) is making fresh rounds, sneakily infiltrating people's machines via emails purporting to come from Google.
0.388548613603838 These threats include Cryptolocker, CryptoWall and CTB-Locker, which encrypt users' files with strong cryptographic algorithms, making it impossible to recover them in the absence of unaffected backups or without paying for the decryption keys.
0.4764397094998017 This malware connects to several URLs, leading to the download of the CTB-Locker malware onto the computer.
0.461488005854780 This new variant has a popup window that uses CTB-Locker-style instructions.
0.4590903931647616 Using the same URLs as those of the CTB-Locker malware suggests that the threat actors distributing the ransomware are also dabbling in phishing.
0.4888000115239653 We are here to warn you of the "Onion" ransomware (aka CTB-Locker), which uses anonymous TOR (The Onion Router) network and Bitcoins to better protect criminals, their funds and keys to victims' files from law enforcement.
0.433886445637234 We can see here that the malware just used an RTF file as a decoy, but has actually downloaded the CTB-Locker trojan into the user's system and executed it.
0.366001875509952 We soon came across an "improved" version of CTB-Locker Ransomware , which now offered a "free decryption" service, an extended deadline to decrypt the files, and an option to change the language of the ransom message.

0.3355855722910824 Aviv Raff, the CTO at Seculert, who has studied financial malware, told SCMagazine.com on Tuesday that this malware does not appear to be Ploutus.
0.364126688358399 But the report noted that statements by police regarding how attackers gained control of the ATMs indicate that either the Backdoor.Ploutus or Backdoor.Padpin trojan is at work.
0.502410377003256 Earlier this year, ATMs were plagued by the Ploutus malware and just last week Kaspersky Labs released details about attackers compromising ATMs by using the Tyupkin malware.
0.1348941989397953 In late October, security firm Symantec discovered an updated English-language version of Ploutus.
0.3731865613476984 In May 2013, security experts spotted another ATM Trojan dubbed Padpin ; meanwhile in October 2013, malware researchers isolated samples of another malware dubbed Ploutus that was circulated to compromise banking machines and steal cash from them.
0.354086028027494 Other ways to protect against the Ploutus attack include using physical protection and security cameras to monitor the ATM, since the attack cannot be done entirely remotely.

0.2029287603350824 Symantec's recent report on the capabilities of the Ploutus malware served to underscore the issue, but also drew some critics who highlighted the difficulties of getting away with opening up a machine and inserting a mobile phone, USB stick, or anything else.
0.0732930940049135 The Ploutus malware allows attackers to send an SMS message to a phone that is attached to an ATM.

0.3386841308608733 But what is interesting about Anunak, Group-IB and Fox-IT noted, is that some of its core hackers are actually the developers of the banking Trojan Carberp , which emerged in 2010 - illustrating the blurring line between malware attacks waged against retail and banking, the firms said.
0.547795867472420 By analyzing the "SAP Trojan", which was dubbed Gamker, the researchers discovered that its remote control code is the same as that of Carberp, but it's impossible to tell if the two types of malware are the product of same developers.

0.705953148032319 According to CBL, some of these systems were running Gameover Zeus and Hesperbot malware.
0.713774551545525 After the takedowns of the Gameover Zeus and Shylock botnets, researchers predicted that a new breed of banking malware would fill the void.
0.204056014755354 Along with that advisory was a national press release from the US Department of Justice and the FBI that announced a multi-national effort against the GameOver Zeus botnet.

0.549496216173603 Also, the report highlights Upatre , a loader previously used for delivering GOZ, which is now being used to deliver Dyreza.
0.4749971335575847 Although not as widespread as the Gameover malware knocked out by law enforcement in June 2014, Shylock had some of the same methods and the same motivation to crack into victims' bank accounts.
0.0809281744176567 Although ransomware that locks files until victims pay to restore them has existed for many years, it became more prevalent after the Gameover Zeus botnet operators introduced the once widespread but now-defunct CryptoLocker malware in early February 2015.
0.2134568077196763 And while the early leader, CryptoLocker, was taken down (along with the "Gameover ZeuS" botnet) last June , other improved "ransomware" packages have sprung up to fill its niche-including the sound-alike CryptoWall.
0.0823203509775206 And yesterday, the answer to our query was this: Gameover ZeuS has some additional strings.
0.736419006310995 Apparently, the old adage about old dogs and new tricks doesn't always hold up: Old dog GameOver Zeus has learned something new: The criminals behind the malware delivery system for the banking Trojan are now encrypting their executable file so that as it doesn't trigger common defenses.

0.505708887496459 As explained by Dave Loftus, security analyst at Arbor Networks until law enforcement arrest the member of the gang behind the GameOver Zeus botnet , the growth of the malicious network will continue.
0.1388435539018412 As the FBI indicated, it was extremely common for GameOver Zeus infected computers to ALSO become infected with CryptoLocker.
0.688162444978143 As well, cyberespionage campaigns and assaults on government systems from nation-states, the rise of malware, and the takedown of Cryptolocker Gameover Zeus have been top challenges for security personnel.
0.559289307270268 As you can imagine, the question that a number of people have asked us is, "Was this a one-off, or a genuine Gameover comeback?".

0.3154805893993 But because GameOver utilizes a P2P network of infected hosts to communicate and distribute data, and employs encryption to evade detection, it doesn't have a single point of failure\u2026and makes takedown efforts more difficult.".

0.312115944704560 However, this week has seen one positive proactive move by law enforcers, when the FBI, UK National Crime Agency and Europol joined forces to disrupt the GameOver Zeus botnet and CryptoLocker .
0.720663496305060 If you are using a browser which GameOver doesn't support ( Lynx anyone? , or a native 64-bit browser), it may be that your computer is infected, but the browser has no traces of the malware.
0.531824830426294 If you launch the file, it downloads an unstructured lump of data - known to programmers as a BLOB, short for "binary large object" - which is actually an obfuscated and compressed copy of the Gameover malware:
0.368580227622314 If you suspect to be infected, Symantec has released a new tool to allow removal of Gameover Zeus infection from the victim's machine, data provided by the security company confirms that US and Italy are the counties most affected by the botnet.
0.559017231524464 In addition to the efforts to disrupt the Gameover ZeuS botnet, the DOJ led a separate effort to disrupt Cryptolocker, by "identifying and seizing computer servers acting as command and control hubs for the Cryptolocker malware.".
0.4508163616386454 In early July, a group of cyber criminals released a modified version of the Gameover ZeuS banking trojan, using a technique known as a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to make disrupting the botnet more difficult.
0.46069045592613 In early June 2014, international law enforcement agencies combined to carry out a hugely successful action called Operation Tovar against the cybercrime group behind the malware family known variously as Gameover , Gameover Zeus or GOZ .
0.3819633586832489 In fact, the crooks can do pretty much anything they like, not least because Gameover, like most zombie malware, includes a general-purpose "download, install and launch yet more malware" function.
0.0970009187777581 In June 2014, the U.S. Justice Department joined authorities in many other countries and a large number of security firms in taking down the Gameover ZeuS botnet , which at the time was estimated to have infected more than a million PCs.
0.62705112051102 In March, Dell SecureWorkds named Shylock one of the Top Banking Botnets of 2013, citing that it was responsible for 7% of the banking malware it detected (behind only GameOver ZeuS, Citadel, and other variants of ZeuS).
0.2994543511107806 In one spam campaign, fraudsters tricked users into installing Gameover by sending spurious emails designed to look like browser updates from Microsoft.
0.21827525538739 In other words, finding out you've had Gameover for the past month is like realising you forgot to hang up the phone and your boss has been listening in to the last 30 minutes of garrulous tittle-tattle you've been having with your chums.

0.1051929749915254 In some cases, crooks conducting cyberheists against businesses have been launching DDoS assaults against the victim's bank - as in the case of account takeovers involving the Gameover Trojan .
0.0885885290601432 In the case of Gameover, that purpose was to distribute the Zeus trojan, which in turn would perform a wire fraud scheme that involves stealing financial credentials from infected users' computers and then sending money from the victims' accounts to those controlled by the attackers.
0.0500836926301174 In the event the infected Gameover systems can't get new instructions from their peers, the code instructs the botted systems to seek out domains from the latest list of 1,000 domains generated by the DGA until it finds a site with new instructions.
0.690744356592584 In the over 250,000 samples F-Secure Labs processes a day, our analysts have seen similar Affiliate models used with the largest banking trojans and GameOver ZeuS, which he notes are also coming from Russia.
0.153390062110044 In the same way that we casually use the word virus these days to talk about malware in general, rather than just the special sort of malware that spreads by itself, so we talk about Zeus and Gameover to mean a whole raft of malware produced as part of extensive cybercrime operations.

0.3483971639539704 The Gameover botnet code also includes a failsafe mechanism that can be invoked if the botnet's P2P communications system fails, whether the failure is the result of a faulty malware update or because of a takedown effort by researchers/law enforcement.
0.446368186401492 The Gameover takedown has also spawned at least three distinct new botnets.
0.3311235945565985 The Gameover variant of the nefarious Zeus banking trojan has recently been observed sneaking past defenses as an encrypted EXE file, according to researchers with Malcovery.
0.701776000691378 The GameOver Zeus botnet, disrupted only two months ago by an international joint operation, continues to echo throughout the cybercrime landscape.
0.787577847746010 The goal of Operation Tovar was to seize control of the Gameover ZeuS botnet , a sprawling network of infected computers running Microsoft Windows that has been used by elite cyber criminals to steal more than $100 million from banks, business, and consumers.
0.3091550363110263 The headlines in 2014 were filled with news about "takedowns," which are collaborative efforts typically between the private sector, governments and academia designed to shut down a cyber crime operation, such as a botnet (like GameOver ZeuS ) or banking trojan (like Shylock).
0.0579385265824834 The Internet Service Providers involved in the action against GOZeuS and Cryptolocker are able to take advantage of the intelligence behind the law enforcement operation to identify which of their customers are infected, to notify them and assist them with clean-up.

0.3262842847815563 The new GameOver Zeus no longer utilizes the P2P protocol but but generates a series of domain with a DGA algorithm , this makes easy for bad actors to quickly rebuilding their malicious infrastructure even more law enforcement take down it.
0.762456138239887 The operation against Gameover and CryptoLocker by law enforcement is most welcome, and should be applauded .
0.580636584889109 The operation was a success, shutting down activity from the Gameover botnet for the past month.

0.746465836176309 This May, the GameOver Zeus botnet made history by becoming one of the largest botnets ever seized by law enforcement.
0.454320951284976 This model is quite similar to that of GOZeuS, and quite unlike malware like BlackShades, which is sold on the black market to anyone for about $40 a pop.
0.1813115426645458 This particular strain of Gameover is taking a fresh approach.
0.572531514362690 This takedown operation continues a trend that began in June with Operation Tovar , the effort to take down the Gameover ZeuS botnet -- an international, public-private collaboration principally aimed at disrupting the crimes, instead of arresting the criminals.
0.318941605634065 Though other P2P botnets such as Kelihos exist, Gameover is notable for its use of proxy nodes to introduce complexity into the standard P2P infrastructure.
0.448858913124312 Today's column features an interview with two security experts who helped plan and execute last week's global, collaborative effort to hijack the Gameover Zeus botnet , an extremely resilient and sophisticated crime machine that helped an elite group of thieves steal more than $100 million from banks, businesses and consumers worldwide.

0.3735634033426382 Unlike many Zeus operators, however, the gang behind Gameover doesn't sell their version of the code directly, but instead allows customers to lease the botnet for their attacks.
0.7595990291448 Unlike Team Fortress 2 or Doom, two of the most popular PC games of all time, GameOver ZeuS is not a game you can buy online or would willingly download on to your computer.
0.711638348992535 U.S. authorities also filed charges this week against Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev (a.k.a. Slavik), a Russian citizen who they say is the mastermind behind the Cryptolocker and Gameover gang, which has stolen more than $130 million.
0.601209043680964 U.S. law enforcement agencies have obtained civil and criminal court orders in Pittsburgh authorizing them to sinkhole Gameover Zeus traffic, with this technique the security experts can profile the botnet, evaluate its extension and interrupt communication between compromised machines and the C&C servers.
0.502954509256401 We anticipate the criminal infrastructure of both Gameover Zeus and CryptoLocker will re-establish operations as quickly as they can.
0.589083074057547 We do not know if it is being operated by the same people that were indicted last month, or a subset of them, or indeed a different group altogether that has obtained the Gameover source code.
0.754515501537004 We have found only 23 domains related to this specific variant of Gameover.
0.3502712490174566 We recently wrote about an international takedown operation , spearheaded by US law enforcement, against the Gameover and CryptoLocker malware.
0.648574434857127 Week in review: Defeating UEFI's SecureBoot, Gameover Zeus botnet disrupted, first Android file-encrypting Trojan.
0.288383283380348 What constitutes winning in the fight against malware, and what's the value of a takedown ask commentators in the wake of Gameover Zeus' bounceback.
0.542540908049782 When an international law enforcement action earlier this month knocked out the Gameover botnet , one happy consequence was the takedown of the servers that the CryptoLocker ransomware needed in order to do its dirty work.
0.743953486592650 When it comes to financial crime, malware disruptions in 2014 changed the threat landscape by eliminating two prevalent malware families: the June takeover of Gameover Zeus (GOZ), which sent shockwaves through the criminal underworld, and a takedown of Shylock in July.
0.2216956207440359 When it launches, Gameover installs into your Application Data directory, tagging itself with a short block of system-specific binary data.
0.55483611588073 "Whether that's because they're using the old infrastructure or it's just a rise in the new variants, we're not sure," says Morten Kjaersgaard, CEO of the company, which has been tracking the success of the Gameover Zeus takedown operation.
0.2393834417483461 While we can't say for certain that the people responsible for Gameover and CryptoLocker have ceased all criminal activity, they have not regained control of the network disrupted by Operation Tovar.
0.4852822459043397 Why it is increasing is not clear but it could be that criminals have turned to it as other forms of previously successful ransom malware, for instance CryptoLocker, have been destroyed (Damballa being among the firms that helped with the downing of its distribution platform, Gozeus, during Operation Tovar).
0.505682179574592 With co-operation from the Ukrainian authorities, seized and copied key Gameover command servers in Kiev and Donetsk.

0.2526970434473644 Worryingly, the firm has spotted a new variant of Gameover Zeus featuring a new Domain Generation Algorithm set-up, trying to build a new botnet.
0.436573560066079 You can see why CryptoLocker captured the imagination more than Gameover: CryptoLocker is one of those in-your-face, "so near but so far" threats.
0.503050311777287 ZBOT malware of this generation are found to be mostly either Citadel or GameOver variants.

0.6576991768285 A malicious DLL which is also part of other versions of the Neutrino exploit pack (discussed later in this article).
0.560523269513633 Additionally, there have been reports of another new exploit kit called "Neutrino" being sold in the underground.
0.35673600533311 Based on an underground forum, the people behind Neutrino also offer a rent on their servers with server maintenance services.
0.135617357198296 By the summer of 2013, we saw Neutrino use HTTP over port 8000, and the traffic patterns had evolved.
0.1170768363448618 Detailed technical analyses of the inner workings of the Blackhole kit are already available in the existing literature, as well as for Neutrino.
0.0622296711941626 Effective exploit kit delivery mechanisms, such as Neutrino, and unpatched vulnerabilities targeting Java 6 create a significant challenge for organizations that have not updated to Java 7.".
0.791983367835215 Found this EK in the progress of infection, the URI reference is showed as Neutrino Exploit Kit, but maybe a different / a new one too (feel free to advise us the right/better name).
0.505583321453986 Glazunov/Sibhost (48 percent) is now leading the pack by far, followed by Neutrino (35 percent), Stix (3 percent), Sweet Orange (3 percent), and Cool (2 percent).
0.538804768523440 In September 2014 after the Neutrino exploit kit (EK) had disappeared for 6 months, it reappeared in a different form.
0.54779998739043 It wasn't until March 2015 that we observed Neutrino Flash pack attacks on the computers of 60,541 users.
0.1066492636472163 Lately, we have seen a number of communications through our automated framework from the Neutrino botnet.
0.1071466160845038 Looking at this data, the Neutrino, Glazunov and Sibhost exploit kits are currently dominant.
0.752276030183642 Neutrino has a simple control panel and includes features that evade antivirus and IPS systems when exploited successfully.
0.2936148524163225 Neutrino was first reported in March 2013 by Kafeine on his Malware Don't need Coffee blog [2].

It's clear the cybercriminals know there is a Java update problem for many organizations," Matthew Mors of Websense wrote in an analysis of the trend."Forty percent of Java 6 users are vulnerable to these new exploits and there are no software patches in sight. Effective exploit kit delivery mechanisms, such as Neutrino, and unpatched vulnerabilities targeting Java 6 create a significant challenge for organizations that have not updated to Java 7."

0.1795632094322523 Security experts at TrendLabs remarked that this quarter Neutrino Exploit Kit included a Java 6 vulnerability, a version no more supported by Oracle, the company also announced that around 31 recently disclosed vulnerabilities will never be patched triggering the interest of cybercrime community.
0.3819111569828752 Shown above: Neutrino EK sends the malware payload.
0.325551916989339 Since 2005, when Mpack was first released, over 100 individually marketed exploit packs -- with names like Black Hole, Neutrino, and Sweet Orange -- have been sold to leverage the World Wide Web and to exploit victims' computers.
0.3829581015154811 Some of the computers were also redirected to domains hosting other exploit kits such as Neutrino and Magnitude in order to server further malicious code.
0.282486845322439 Some of the infected computers then appear to have been directed to websites hosting other exploit kits such as Neutrino and Magnitude, loading yet more malware.

0.0985296230954666 The methods in Neutrino are quite similar to others; however, the highlighted features in Neutrino mean that attackers are indeed becoming more sophisticated and organized.
0.501506533189485 The Neutrino exploit kit took more of a whitehat path to obfuscation and fetches the code, in parts, using AJAX .
0.457937263517086 The researchers suspect that the exploit kit served by the cyber criminals could be the Neutrino kit or the Sweet Orange kit .
0.2441944162411707 The (Russian) Neutrino exploit kit was first described by the French researcher Kafeine (Malware don't need Coffee) almost exactly one year ago.
0.540594579493681 Zaccess (MagicTraffic one) pushed in Neutrino 2013-10-15.
0.2327688864021345 However, Seculert's Research Lab believed that this conclusion was incorrect, and upon further analysis discovered the culprit was not ZxShell, but instead a totally different malware that functioned as a backdoor, downloader, and information stealer.
0.676572637434508 If ZxShell successfully connects to the remote host, the function DoHandshake is called.
0.545806904569915 Initially, the malware used in the attack was reported to be ZxShell (aka Sensocode), a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
0.0759300748954460 The malicious JavaScript code loads a Flash object that in turn infects the victim with a payload that downloads a backdoor ZxShell Trojan.
0.317540400926964 The particular variant of the ZxShell backdoor called back to a command and control server located at newss[]effers[]com.., which at the time of publishing resolves to 118.99.60.142.
0.3226075050295259 The watchdog thread checks the registry path of the ZxShell service every 2 seconds, to verify that it hasn't been modified.
0.686673463432078 This activity leveraged exploit code for a zero-day vulnerability now identified as CVE-2014-0322 and ultimately infected victims with ZxShell malware.
0.601470475485045 This is important because if any system tool tries to open the host process it will never display the ZxShell DLL.
0.24081994571941 ZxShell exploits this fact by cycling between each of the names, verifying the existence of the real service.
0.545267959566158 ZxShell implemented its own version of the Windows SC command.
0.51865173855509 VOBFUS.JDN is a dangerous computer infection which belongs to the Vobfus family.
0.4048129657732244 According to security firm Trend Micro, worms in the Vobfus family function as "downloaders of other malware," which can be leveraged by attackers to remotely steal data on compromised machines.
0.2053711214058693 And to make matters even thornier for network security professionals, Win32/Beebone and Vobfus also install an auto-run file on any disk or drive they infect, including USB flash drives.
0.609767146622935 Beebone would then initiate and download Vobfus in addition to other threats, which in turn would do the same.
0.2723278833331014 Microsoft has documented a curious infection cycle between the Vobfus worm and the Beebone Trojan , where Vobfus variants will download Beebone variants, which in turn download Vobfus variants, and so on.
0.181932793475020 Microsoft's Malware Protection Center observed an infection cycle in the wild where Vobfus variants download Beebone variants that in turn download more Vobfus malware that then went and downloaded other strains of Beebone that did same thing, presumably until someone stepped in and stopped prevented it from doing so.
0.537661386951562 The post Win32/Beebone and Vobfus Working Together to Avoid Antivirus Products & Evade Removal appeared first on Seculert Blog on Advanced Persistent Threats and Malware .

0.410903466173661 A 20-year-old computer science student was sentenced to a year and a half in prison for using Blackshades to spy on and attempt to extort a former Miss Teen USA.
0.433094458845459 A Swedish man pleaded guilty Wednesday to peddling one of the most prevalent spying programs called Blackshades that was widely used by the criminal underground.
0.474170379595129 About 700,000 PCs worldwide are estimated to have been infected with the malware and the NCA claims that about 200,000 usernames and passwords for various online services have been extracted using Blackshades from users in the UK alone.
0.770483559720329 According to court documents, the Blackshades RAT was bought by at least several thousand users (law enforcement officials found roughly 6,000 customer profiles) in more than 100 countries and was used to infect more than half a million computers worldwide.
0.3975799524363423 According to officials who spoke to Time Magazine , law enforcement agencies swooped on Blackshades users in Europe, Asia and the US.
0.644555851788044 After infecting more than a half-million machines across more than 100 countries, you were shown to be running your hacking operation like a very organized and professional business, replete with paid staff, customer service personnel -- even a marketing director to promote Blackshades.
0.701087751731861 Alex Yucel, 24, the alleged co-author of the Blackshades remote access Trojan (RAT) and owner-operator of the BlackShades organization, pleaded not guilty Thursday to multiple cybercrime charges levied against him last week as part of a major FBI sting that netted more than 90 other arrests.
0.05712577712747568 Alex Yucel, 24, who is the co-author of the Blackshades Remote Access Trojan (RAT), owned and operate an organization called Blackshades.
0.2555214302241801 Almost 100 alleged hackers, including 17 from the UK, have been arrested around the world for distributing and using the Blackshades remote access Trojan (RAT).
0.442961705971137 Although in recent years a license to Blackshades sold for several hundred Euros, early versions of the product were sold via PayPal for just USD $40.
0.659577433097046 Although inexpensive, the Blackshades RAT has an extensive set of capabilities such as keystroke logger, web cam control, full file access, etc. More than enough for the cyber attacker to assume the full identity of the owner of the compromised computer to allow them easy access to the business critical servers inside the data center as depicted in the diagram.
0.1745431578228334 Among those arrested in the CarderProfit sting was Michael Hogue , the alleged co-creator of Blackshades.
0.453875208787667 An advertisement for a cracked version of Blackshades on a overworld hacker forum.
0.05730148187273320 As far as Blackshades being done with, it's possible that a lack of interest due to the high profile of this malware might drive away a large portion of the market, in which case Blackshades won't be updated and it's functionality will become obsolete.
0.575947503115072 As the FBI reported in the criminal complaint , the nastyware that turned up in the search of his computers and the analysis of his electronic slime trail included evidence of keylogging, plus messages relating to the use of two remote-access tools (RATs) or Trojans - Blackshades and Darkcomet - which can be used to control victims' computers, including turning on a computer's camera.
0.547592095029595 Attackers with programs like Blackshades , which was cracked down on earlier this year, can essentially hack their way into your computer and use your camera at will.
0.0662796573944525 Blackshades allows the remote attacker to turn on the victim PC's microphone and/or webcam.
0.380182551336453 Blackshades, however, is particularly infamous for being used by would-be stalkers and other such unsavory elements to spy on women.
0.4094301646283753 Blackshades is a popular and powerful remote access Trojan (RAT) that is used by a wide spectrum of threat actors, from entry level hackers right up to sophisticated cybercriminal groups.
0.639603179127516 Blackshades is particularly pernicious as it can be hidden from anti-virus software by using obfuscated code.
0.744810339157937 Blackshades Server Binary Builder.
0.480246095662139 Blackshades was sold as a toolkit, which was used to create the actual malware, detected as WORM_SWISYN.SM .
0.1513459142681907 Blackshades was usually sold for $40 a pop, for the most updated version.
0.336602929163323 Blackshades, which can be used for legitimate purposes such as accessing a work machine from home, is better known for the shady things that hackers have used it for including keystroke logging and the taking over of webcams.
0.558407539867066 Competitively priced, with a rich feature list, Blackshades provides the attacker with complete control over an infected machine.
0.606371546970880 Early on in its development, researchers at CitzenLab discovered that Blackshades was being used to spy on activists seeking to overthrow the regime in Syria .
0.1283603138960037 Even law enforcement knows Blackshades wasn't a huge menace, outside of its occasional usage to spy on people via webcams and extortion attempts.
0.5189250868563 Fortunately, the interest in Blackshades has decreased due to an array of different issues with the product.
0.353254410056145 He added that the multi-pronged, international law enforcement effort to target Blackshades users could be an effective strategy.
0.1958902403107152 In March, Jared Abrahams, a 20-year-old computer science major, was arrested and accused of using Blackshades to blackmail Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf (a former classmate of his) and at least eight other women.
0.518786016505063 It seemed that the people running BlackShades forgot that they were running an illegal operation.
0.1590699341624162 Johnston was a paid employee of the Blackshades organization who conducted marketing and sales and managed a customer tech support team, officials say.
0.4755763911713465 Law enforcement agencies in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia have been praised after they worked together to arrest almost 100 hackers - including 17 from the UK - allegedly associated with the Blackshades Remote Access Trojan.
0.659088861682000 Monitoring and escalation is key to detecting and minimizing the impact that Blackshades might have on your environment.
0.377971640772741 On Friday, we reported about the large-scale operation of International raids launched by the FBI and other law enforcement officials in countries around the world to arrest the targeted customers of a popular Remote Administration Tool (RAT) called 'Blackshades,' which is designed to take over the remote control of the infected computers and steal information.
0.789423376249740 One factor behind cybercrime's growth was briefly exposed in the recent Blackshades arrests of nearly 100 people who had purchased malware tools "as-a-service," and, allegedly with minimal technical skills, attacked and commandeered the systems of countless victims.
0.2555013698639375 One famous case of Blackshades use was that of Jared James Abrahams, 20, the sextortionist who preyed on around 150 women including Miss Teen USA, Cassidy Wolf .
0.541250339767862 One proof point on how effective this innovation engine has become, we need to remember that one of the original authors of Blackshades was arrested in 2012 and yet Blackshades continues to be developed by the community.
0.1119550669569772 Rappa was also a Blackshades customer who used it to operate victims' webcams and steal their personal data, court documents allege.
0.2902037424604838 Symantec revealed in November last year that hundreds of C&C servers were being used to gather credentials from computers as part of a resurgent Blackshades campaign, despite one of the authors of the malware having been arrested in 2012.
0.1789259603682872 Taking off the Blackshades (Cyber-crime) Malware Threat Intelligence Lead Adam Kujawa took on Blackshades , the potential danger one may encounter who are willing to use RATs for their own personal advantage, the troubles of having such a Trojan installed on a system, and the prediction that RATs will continue to become a threat.
0.290938955224554 The arrests follow an FBI-led operation in May that resulted in the arrests of 100 alleged Blackshades RAT users across more than a dozen countries.
0.4634349667967253 The Blackshades malware reflects this growing sophistication.
0.1851134460101643 The co-creator of the $40 Blackshades Remote Access Tool (RAT) pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal charge of distributing malware that federal authorities said infected half a million computers globally.
0.599756907396697 The FBI led the charge against users of the malware, who purchased Blackshades from an underground marketplace known as "bshades.eu", according to the Wall Street Journal .
0.629619823698763 The scale of the arrests-rarely have so many cybercriminals been arrested in one go-is entirely due to Blackshades' ease of use.
0.764343385383227 The US government seized more than 1,900 domain names used by Blackshades customers to control infected computers.
0.0644250247122152 They are also usually sold for far more than the malware itself, in fact Blackshades had a built-in crypter marketplace that it included in it's control panel, to make it easy for the bad guys to find a crypter and apply it to their malware.
0.733734666908543 This means that if an old version of Blackshades was encrypted with a modern crypter tool, it could potentially bypass an antivirus scan and even email filters that check for malware (Thanks Gmail!).
0.406680785146057 Those using Blackshades were targeted in a massive law enforcement effort in May 2014 involving 16 countries.
0.609370268976941 Trend Micro protects users from this threat by detecting the created RATs, as well as blocking the main site that sold Blackshades.
0.3470614104949233 TrendMicro researchers say that another problem BlackShades brought upon itself was that, because of its very accessible, user-friendly nature, it appealed to amateur ne'er-do-wells, enabled "entry-level cybercrime," and left itself more exposed to risk.
0.405161850558480 While the Blackshades' product and services were exemplary, Yucel's failings in finance and risk management might be his undoing.
0.482731172250122 Worldwide Law Enforcement Operation Nabs Blackshades Malware Users.
0.1299331993330935 A backdoor , named "CoolReaper," apparently installed by Chinese phone-maker Coolpad in its Android-based mobile devices leaves users vulnerable to malicious activity, researchers at Palo Alto Networks have revealed.
0.602055224948291 Coolpad has also modified the Android OS present in several ROMs to hide CoolReaper components from the user and from other applications operating on the mobile devices.

0.1317816273760398 For instance, this year a Chinese security researcher reported finding a security flaw in a website that appears to be one used by Coolpad to manage CoolReaper.
0.775631214860723 In the hands of a malicious attacker, CoolReaper can be used to upload data about the device, location, application usage, and calling history.
0.560144490585788 Researchers find 'CoolReaper' backdoor in CoolPad devices.
0.769435736737135 The backdoor CoolReaper allows the attackers to gain complete control of Android device.
0.765866634997783 The experts explained that CoolReaper is the first malware they have seen that was built and operated by an Android manufacturer.
0.2004618820795158 The impact could be really serious, more than 10 million users worldwide are menaced by the presence of the CoolReaper on the mobile devices.
0.565575689272115 Another interesting twist, according to Trend's research, is that the bad guys behind the Predator Pain and Limitless malware still retain administrative rights to the malware when they sell a copy; they get access to the victims that the buyers infect, as well.
0.558514642016028 Our paper titled Predator Pain and Limitless: When Cybercrime Turns into Cyberspying discusses our findings about these tools, as well as what we know about the attacks that are being carried out with them.
0.298630232593462 Researchers at Trend Micro have been analyzing two keyloggers, dubbed Predator Pain and Limitless, and they recently released a paper on their findings.
0.795833765400299 Running the executable results in a number of events on the target PC which are consistent with keyloggers created by the Predator Pain builder [Trend Micro PDF].
0.535311087207927 Take for example Predator Pain and Limitless, two low-priced ($40 or less), off-the-shelf keyloggers/RATs that are able to collect and exfiltrate the following types of information from infected machines: Wielded by cybercriminals targeting small and medium-sized businesses in Hong Kong, they netted them $75 million in the first half of this year alone, as estimated by the Commercial Crime Bureau of Hong Kong Police Force.
0.277371802948225 The breached SMBs can often provide a stepping-stone to a larger and more lucrative business partner, for instance, which makes the Predator Pain and Limitless attacks against smaller, easier targets even more valuable.
0.742054457677513 The full report from Trend, "From Cybercrime to Cyberspying: Using Limitless Keylogger and Predator Pain," is available here .
0.520376866723763 The researchers have analyzed both Predator Pain and Limitless keyloggers for only a few months, discovering a surprising reality.
0.623520721271341 The typical attack with these tools begins with a business-themed phishing email sent to publicly listed email addresses and rigged with Predator Pain or Limitless.
0.446046500178928 Trend Micro issued a research paper on operations behind Predator Pain and Limitless keyloggers, both of which are easily obtainable from underground.

0.334330803688692 The banking Trojan known as Citadel, which debuted in underground forums in January 2012, has evolved to become one of the financial industry's greatest worries, cybersecurity experts say.
0.1639259371298131 The basic Citadel package - a bot builder and botnet administration panel - retails for $2,399 + a $125 monthly "rent," but some of its most innovative features are sold as a la carte add-ons.
0.0981256998991596 The Citadel crimeware toolkit, originally designed to steal sensitive information from infected Windows PCs, has been upgraded to grab the master passwords used to unlock password management applications, according to IBM's Trusteer security division.

0.1719111034386703 The Citadel trojan, a popular program used by cybercriminals to gather banking credentials and steal money from accounts, has become the latest financial malware to be repurposed as a tool to steal industrial secrets-this time from petrochemical companies in the Middle East.
0.416490931886108 The Citadel Trojan is a malware designed to steal personal information, including banking and financial data, from infected machines.
0.1200465803077055 The Citadel trojan is another example of how incisive and targeted malware can be, attacking individual organizations, while also harvesting credentials and passwords from users.
0.1526469869206211 The Citadel Trojan is capable of bypassing most threat detection security systems and laying low until it is instructed spring into action.
0.391384676035485 The Citadel Trojan is currently most prevalent in European countries, and the number of infections is rather small - around 1,000.
0.3909473282689993 The Citadel Trojan is really starting to become kind of a pain in the neck.
0.429120541723775 The company's researchers identified Citadel as the malware used to infect and steal data from the companies, which included "one of the largest sellers of petrochemical products in the Middle East and a regional supplier of raw petrochemical materials," the analysis stated.
0.3374356365497165 The crew behind the Citadel malware recently announced that it would no longer be selling it publicly and would only conduct private sales.
0.772187116880710 The developer, \u201cAquabox,\u201d was banned from an online forum after a Citadel buyer accused him of \u201cbecoming corrupt by all the money Citadel was earning him,\u201d according to a Tuesday blog post from RSA.
0.3237083105306761 "The fact that they used Citadel when it's obsolete tells me either they don't know what they are doing" or the attackers aren't very experienced, he says.
0.331691479044029 The Federal Bureau of Investigation's new warning about Citadel malware attacks has the industry's attention, and for good reason.
0.494275134734631 The feds says Citadel is responsible for more than $500 million in losses worldwide.
0.339800575864842 The level of adoption and development of Citadel is rapidly growing, and since then Seculert has identified over 20 different Citadel botnets (See figures 1 and 2 for statistics), using the following different versions of the malware:
0.621709632939515 "The machine was already infected by Citadel when IBM Trusteer Apex was installed on it.
0.335401105850622 "The most recently discovered Citadel variants have built-in DNS redirect functionality that prevents infected systems from contacting the websites of major IT security vendors and global law enforcement agencies," the report said.
0.0734281275608181 The outfit runs the Citadel Botnets and is believed to have stolen more than $500 million from bank accounts over the past 18 months.
0.1877769031561696 The reason that one malware family , Citadel, could end up responsible for so many distinct cybercrime operations is that Citadel isn't just malware.
0.319629287803451 The research found that a configuration file, which attackers use to tailor the Citadel trojan for specific campaigns, had been modified to start up a keylogger when the user opened either Password Safe or KeePass, two open-source password managers.
0.2033405252535055 The researchers went on to say that the same attacks-which exploit weaknesses in the way Microsoft code processes TIFF images-is being waged by yet another group, alternately dubbed Arx and Ark, to deliver the Citadel trojan.
0.229290133581307 The rumors were soon hushed and ties to Citadel were denied, mostly in what appeared as a case of fearful fraudsters who did not want to be denied the possibility to buy the next Trojan."
0.4587573048879236 The same thing happened to other security researchers, and the Abuse.ch researcher estimated that 25 percent of the Citadel domains seized in the operation were legitimate sinkholes operated by researchers.
0.05396350093719548 The security team at Trusteer, an IBM company, has just discovered a Citadel variant that takes this approach a step further, providing enhanced survivability for the attack as well as expanding this malware's capabilities to perpetrate targeted attacks on enterprises."
0.782842750353130 The string of espionage campaigns marks a significant departure for the group of developers behind the Citadel Trojan.
0.613087128308129 Then on Aug. 17, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center issued a public alert about a Citadel attack launched with ransomware feigning to be from the FBI.
0.641296633310322 Then there is the Citadel Trojan, which was dangerous in its own unique way, using an open-source development model that let anyone review its code and improve upon it.
0.315823585024981 There are several improvements that make Citadel stand out, and give credence to the authors' attempts to make Citadel the crimeware kit of choice for cybercrooks:
0.410933000204950 "There is significant amount of recent activity, as late as Jan. 13, to suggest that private customers will continue to use Citadel to attack business and government organizations.".
0.1102309580335698 These are not your average hackers; they didn't just buy a version of the Citadel malware.
0.603441400871275 These botnet logs were from the Citadel botnet Version 1.3.4.5 (Extreme Edition).
0.1655203068196592 "They disrupted more than 1,000 botnets operated by Citadel, but it's important that people understand that while the operation was important, it didn't solve the problem," Maor said. "They disrupted botnets that were up and running, but anyone who has the Citadel builder can build a new variant and distribute it. They didn't eliminate Citadel. Yeah, business took a hit, but it can be recreated."
0.4937565723006671 This case helps us see that Citadel is being used for interests other than financial crime."
0.2254137354376620 This configuration file shows how flexible and powerful the Citadel platform is.
0.0881915051873459 This in turn led to a general belief that Citadel would decline in use.
0.633954446080736 This overall process has remained the same through Citadel revisions, but the specifics of the encryption algorithms have changed.
0.654953704301899 This particular Citadel variant also included a form-grabber, or HTTP POST grabber-which steals user input from a form before it's encrypted via SSL, for example.
0.787085293239933 This too was hoped to be a major disruption, although Microsoft's assistant general counsel at its Digital Crimes Unit, Richard Boskovich, said at the time, "due to Citadel's size and complexity, we do not expect to fully take out all of the botnets in the world using the Citadel malware.".

0.708305002961322 One of the consequences of Michelangelo was the use of date-specific triggers by virus authors, typically with damaging payloads, such as deleting files or, like Michelangelo, corrupting disks.

0.4002174793563021 While I'm not inclined to comment on the accuracy or inaccuracy of these reports in general, I feel obliged to comment on a meme that has come up time and time again in those same reports: it seems to have become 'historical fact' that (a) McAfee announced that 5 million PCs were infected with the Michelangelo boot sector virus, whose highly destructive payload would trigger on March 6th (b) that when March 6th actually rolled round, the predicted devastation proved to be 'hype' or 'a dud'.
0.346420568904828 For example, the Michelangelo virus gained a great deal of media attention, but the actual damage caused by the virus was pretty small.
0.725185915983581 This was probably due to the continuing pain caused by the Conficker worm and the boom in threats such as Mytob, Upatre and ZeuS, which all use spam as their main infection vector.

0.547650922641372 However, unlike the Reveton/IcePol malware it appears to mimic - which installs automatically with no action by the victim - this ransomware requires the user to enable sideloading and manually install it.
0.155742289507548 If any miscreants have the ability to pay $10,000 per month to rent an exploit pack, the gangs spreading Reveton certainly fit the bill.
0.4067420917952525 If just one percent of the Reveton gang's more than 5 million victims lost similar collections of photographs - that's equal to 300 million USD in lost data.
0.561159678399283 In August, the FBI warned of a similar scam involving the Reveton malware , which was related to the Citadel banking Trojan.
0.712530512403977 In February 2013, a key figure behind the Reveton ransomware was arrested and that led to a decrease in ransomware as an active threat.
0.2266407013504446 In that instance, attackers were using Citadel in drive-by downloads to install Reveton, which was then locking up victims' computers and demanding a $100 fee to unlock them.

0.3494870274268857 It is certainly possible that crooks are using Citadel to deploy Reveton, but as I'll illustrate below, it seems more likely that the attackers in these cases are using exploit kits like BlackHole to plant both threats on victim PCs.
0.661110602075078 It locks your computer , like the Reveton family of malware , with the intention of leaving you unable to do anything else until you pay up.
0.533449260803690 It's interesting to note that this time around, police ransomware or the REVETON malware branched out to target more systems in the United States as the bad guys have seemingly perfected their wares for a much larger market, which of course include users who are not familiar with these PC-locking scams.
0.704374541939429 It's not a huge surprise when we can speculate that the team behind is the same that was first using Cool EK (Paunch VIP customer) and is behind the Reveton threat.

0.522316887019970 According to several of my sources who have helped with or participated in the investigation that led to this week's arrests, the group used ZeuS to steal online banking credentials from tens of thousands of victims, but it focused on extracting money from high-dollar commercial accounts belonging to businesses.

0.4401788906715430 After ZeuS , an infamous banking Trojan, came Kronos, which is capable of stealing information from highly popular Internet browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome.
0.588286683587280 Afterwards, It downloads an additional malicious executable file which in this case is a Zbot Trojan, a notorious Trojan that is capable of stealing banking information.
0.1474640606732179 Alex Cox, principal research analyst with NetWitness, a Herndon, Va. based security firm, said the attack bears remarkable similarities to the "Hilary Kneber" ZeuS botnet discovered by NetWitness last February.

0.14784895065489 All of the threats from this family in the Top 10 are downloaded onto infected computers by a Trojan from the ZeuS/Zbot family (which we have mentioned numerous times in our reports).

0.1924635231961964 Also of importance to CISOs and other enterprise security professionals is that, according to AppRiver security analyst Jonathan French, some anti-virus products are failing to catch this specific Zeus Trojan variation, even though the Zeus family of Trojans has been around for years.
0.393102141452247 Although applying a digital signature is the most revolutionary improvement, it was not the only upgrade added to Zeus.
0.1297382159129715 Although it is the latest version of the Trojan, an $1,800 price tag pays for a Trojan which still contains more than 98% of Zeus's original code, offers none of the features promised by its author, presents no innovation, and does not seem to pose a real threat.
0.535379380178419 Although the malware can serve practically any type of content, in this specific case it installs a variant of Win32/Zbot, malware designed to steal information from online banking customers.
0.2939843771544141 An alleged cybercrime gang from Ukraine and Russia - two of whom were extradited from the UK - have been charged with using Zeus malware to steal millions of dollars from victims including the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago order of nuns.

0.1141023886384665 An update to the P2P Zeus banking trojan results in the installation of a rootkit driver that makes deleting the malware even tougher.
0.606241910467237 And, after all, there are source codes of ZeuS all over the cyber underground, changing hands and getting upgraded (or spoiled).
0.273441764788192 And it was only a matter of time until a 64-bit version of ZeuS appeared – but we didn't expect it to happen quite so soon.
0.614645835466871 And now please 'welcome' ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.
0.595581594059917 And speaking of botnets, this version of Zeus now comes with a botnet favorite: the Tor privacy network .
0.59879631720020 And the arms race to counter botnets is only going to escalate further now that the sort of peer-to-peer technology used in Kelihos has become commoditized in Zeus, a botnet "platform" at the center of a thriving criminal software ecosystem.
0.35261933695196 And this blog is about new samples (and probably new wave of attack)) of ZitMo for Android and Blackberry.</p> <p><b>New samples overview</b></p> <p>We've got 5 new files of ZitMo: 4 for Blackberry and 1 for Android.
0.311327261330044 And threats such as ZeuS is why our latest Internet Security feature is called Banking Protection which is designed to block men in the middle and form injection attacks.
0.1079101466526067 And what are the chances that we will be able to determine that they actually came from the ZeuS author?
0.1633941717616208 Another domain was hosted on an ISP that has seen significant levels of ZeuS-related activity in the past, and is a known haven for cybercrime.
0.308076073598991 Another important milestone in the story of Zeus is on October 1st, 2010, when the FBI announced it had taken down the main cyber crime network which had used Zeus, stealing nearly $70 million.
0.599764095693633 Another noteworthy addition is this ZBOT's user mode rootkit capability, which effectively hides the malware processes, files, and registry.
0.278711642710374 "Another thing which I've seen is that some [ZeuS botnet command servers] are using geo-IP location, [so that] if a ZeuS group just targets U.K. banks, they will do a geo-location restriction on the [control] server, and allow just bots from the U.K." to ping the servers, he wrote in an instant message.
0.754863390190386 Arbor Networks used data from five sinkholes to assess the threat posed by newGOZ, a Zeus variant that steals banking credentials from victims.
0.3546385817488182 As a simple malware downloader, Bublik is a big component for spreading P2P Zeus, especially for spreading its beta versions.
0.680598300733749 As an added bonus, the group also distributes the Zeus botnet software to enable yet more data theft.
0.499425951998444 As expected, a number of the generated domains became active and were found to be hosting new or updated versions of LICAT and ZeuS configuration files.
0.1804961702908246 As expected of any ZeuS/ZBOT variant, the malware downloads configuration file(s) from randomly generated IP addresses.
0.639122117662958 As I have detailed in more than 75 stories on this topic, ZeuS allows attackers to manipulate the victim's browser and to log in to the victim's bank account using the victim's own PC, effectively negating any security that a device fingerprint or registered computer may provide.
0.0819912071323510 As I wrote in a Feb. 2012 piece, Zeus Trojan Author Ran With Spam Kingpins , Slavik was active on multiple crime forums, not only finding new clients and buyers for his malware, but for the goods harvested by his own botnets powered by ZeuS.
0.233291672527824 As is typical of ZBOT variants, it steals a user's personal information, particularly those related to online banking.
0.552890311202814 As it turns, and unlike the Zeus Trojan's encryption, this is not one of the aspects Harderman invested much into.
0.219900424279255 As seen with popular desktop malware, such as the infamous Zeus , when source code is leaked a whole load of innovation is born.
0.0959147218426762 As the ancestor Zeus , Zitmo has the primary purpose to steal banking credentials in particular to capture the mobile Transaction Authentication Number (mTAN) sent by banks to their customers via SMS message and used to validate an online transaction.
0.357258371953503 As well as sinkholing the Zeus malware servers, Microsoft also knocked out many servers that belonged to security researchers and provided a valuable service to the public by notifying system administrators that they had infected computers on their network.

0.1616022286009313 Following last September's turn of events, where several individuals were arrested for using information stealing Trojans known as the ZeuS toolkit, a much anticipated "upgrade" was inevitable so that it could continue its money-making ploy.
0.304772132528033 For example, banking Trojan Zeus has a range of technologies to steal payment data.
0.2673305321429980 For example, consider the infamous Zeus -a multi-purpose Trojan capable of steal banking information-is freely available to anyone who can find the leaked source code and compile it.
0.1511579166127322 For example, in 2013 hackers targeted NFL fans through fake Facebook pages that were seeded with malicious links serving Zeus malware.
0.362370908357515 For example, security researchers identified one ZeuS variant that was specific to the Ukrainians known as JabberZeuS because it alerted the gang via Jabber instant message whenever online banking credentials for customers of specific institutions were stolen.
0.264860740855799 For example, the Zeus Trojan variant known as Citadel has been seen in the wild targeting non-banking firms, including a petrochemical manufacturer, according to IBM's Trusteer security division.
0.4612468841020458 For example, ZitMo (the mobile 'twin' of Zeus, the infamous Win32 banking Trojan) has been on record since 2010, but until lately it was not known to have been used in mass attacks.

0.4291465793385933 For now, older ZBOT variants will represent the bulk of infection threats.
0.4829885113041656 For sure, there have been other threats, but each has paled in comparison to Zeus in terms of longevity and distribution and - ultimately - effectiveness.
0.798754388197524 For the most recent Android malware, for example, the user had to copy a URL from your PC to your Android device - the (Zeus malware) just displayed the URL and you had to type it in, so it was very clumsy.

0.1222785514029681 Furthermore, while Zeus usually hijacks the user session and performs wire transactions, this variant crawled the site and created a real time copy of the user's Salesforce.com instance that contained all the information from the company account.

0.266629711116120 He had already been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud in 2012, for an early version of Zeus known as Jabber Zeus.
0.576749281165101 He noted that Zeus working via Tor is nothing new, reviewing samples with signs of Tor communications dating back to 2012 when, along with a Zeus infection, the Tor proxy and Tor hidden service were rolled out on infected machines.
0.696823266965022 He observed that much as the leak of the ZeuS code may soon give some enterprising malware coder ideas about how to extend the capabilities of an existing malware family, it appears that someone has taken a tried-and-true bot family and jazzed it up with a new set of wheels.
0.455375266402571 He was charged with other offenses related to his roles in CryptoLocker and earlier versions of ZeuS.
0.3227122867333882 He will instead create new malware (either ZeuS or entirely new families) that he will then primarily sell to high-value clients.
0.2444925547541607 Here is an example screenshot of the updated HTML form data - If the target victim fills in this information, then Zeus will send this information off to it's command and control host.
0.771781518184830 Historically, Zeus-using online criminals have tended to focus their efforts on better-known banks, especially in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.
0.780481773479619 How banking institutions could make wiser investments to stave off the impact of Zeus; Why Zeus' longevity poses new and increasing concerns for security practitioners; How information sharing could improve protections aimed at thwarting malicious attacks waged by Zeus.
0.0848882636024456 However, downloader capability is not a functionality seen in ZeuS to date, therefore further analysis is taking place on this file.
0.544638427766773 However, if they follow this instruction, employees wind up downloading malware that, according to AppRiver security researchers who discovered the campaign, is a new Zeus Trojan variant that steals confidential information and sends it to an adversary's command and control server.
0.743112533412138 However, it could also be merely the consequence of compiler optimization - the result of compiling the bot's code might have been slightly different from that for the original ZeuS code due to the changes, albeit small, introduced into Ice IX. In the ZeuS 2.0.8.9 code, the function that reads data from the registry includes all the API functions required for this task, i. e., RegOpenKeyEx, RegQueryValueEx and RegCloseKey: Figure 3.
0.716642775086221 However, some new samples of the Zeus bot have surfaced that include new features, indicating that development of the tool is still underway.
0.064008436850776 However, the attachment contains a malicious downloader, which downloads Zeus malware in order to steal passwords and user names, as well as monitor specific visited websites.
0.3238604413260962 "However, the attachment was far from innocent. It contained a relatively simple Trojan downloader, that having infected the target machine, would then draw down further payloads to the compromised machine," explained Fred Touchette, AppRiver's senior security analyst, in an emailed statement. "In most of these cases Zeus activity was noticed after the initial infection."
0.464917943765523 However, the code itself looks completely different than in ZeusMitmo.
0.454566712703872 However, the code section responsible for finding and processing email credentials was commented out in the original ZeuS source code.
0.0735254655457074 Hüssy said while there are criminal technologies being built into malware that try to prevent ZeuS Tracker from being able to follow ZeuS botnet infrastructure, he's fairly sure he has managed to bypass it.
0.05347855240787280 Huge amounts of corporate data started flowing to Zeus drop sites: corporate access credentials, sensitive emails and memos, customer data, pricing information, financial records\u2026 The list is endless.
0.762340998998856 Hundreds of new ZeuS variants are seen by Trend Micro every day and this is not likely to change in the near future.
0.0909136356398323 I am sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if therre is any possibility for you to get or build the zeus trojan for me.
0.277309977556415 I can recall a few ZeuS/ZBOT samples targeting Yandex services, but I definitely can't recall anyone targeting MDM Bank or other online Russian banking systems.
0.717421626048497 "I don't think the attack methods are unique from traditional keylogger and Zeus methods," Litan says. "But what is lethal here is the combination and packaging of various tried-and-true hacking techniques."
0.290820363151378 I got a look on the zeus builder who was released by the MMBB guy on exploit.in, finally i'm decided to write something about it, so let's talk about the change in the config encryption.
0.0930427291721919 I had one case two years ago where there was a Zeus bot infection, and they [the victim organization] dismissed it as common malware," Hoglund says
0.2874653514566931 I remember when the Zeus source code was leaked and people started developing their own malware, the chats in the different underground forums was about who they were going to get support from," Maor said.
0.703482691719364 I was reminded of this reality by a feature built into a recent version of the infamous ZeuS trojan that makes it even easier for the crooks to ignore everything except for the goods they're seeking.
0.5834016671705 If a phone number is provided, the user will receive an SMS link pointing to the mobile component, ZeusMitmo.
0.655865061275877 If the server is already inaccessible, the ZBOT malware will unable to download the dynamic configuration file that contains the targeted banking URLs.
0.623578415930255 If the source code for Cryptolocker leaks, then innovation will only spike, as it did with Zeus when its insides we exposed , Lozhkin adds.
0.3489352133464209 "If the ZeuS leak was like giving a machine gun for free, giving away exploit kits is like providing the ammo. We will now see much more use of those exploit and malware kits by less talented groups of cyber criminals," said Aviv Raff, CTO at security firm Seculert, said at the time of the leak of the free version of Black Hole.
0.79374727479173 If you are not a member of NACHA, Zbot also is happy to send you malicious eCards and online banking notifications, and will be quite pleased to add your computer to the botnet and gather your personal banking information.
0.192650210133298 If you visit one of these "targeted" strings, Zeus might be instructed to send the criminal screenshots every time you click your mouse, to send the criminal all of the contents of your web forms, or even trigger to ask you for your Two Factor Authentication.
0.1664283586114734 If your are one of the victim of Zeus, we recommend that you change your passwords for your online accounts and if you have used your credit card while Zeus Trojan was on your computer, contact the bank and let them know that you might be be victim of a phishing attack..
0.3455452372629108 If Zeus is successfully downloaded, it will work as a typical banking trojan, although it also displays some RAT-like characteristics.
0.1516837261662026 In 2010, according to the F.B.I., over $70 million was stolen from banks in the United States using the Zeus Trojan.
0.229523366639294 In 2011, Zbot's source code went public and was used to create (and is still being used to create) new variants of malicious programs, which is impacting attack statistics.
0.2839137708466048 In a lab run of several Zbot samples, I noticed that on average it takes Zbot less than a minute to upload cached passwords.
0.2287672294372988 In a slight variation to this tactic, Malwarebytes and French security researcher Xylitol collaborated in February 2014 to release findings on a new variant of Zeus that used steganography by concealing malware code in JPG images.
0.0632136153556160 In addition, past versions of Zeus left a loophole in which security professionals were able to instruct Zeus to download a new version "upgrade" designed to actually disable the Zeus Trojan on the infected PC; essentially destroying a botnet.
0.514913812557567 In addition to its normal information theft routines, it also infected executable files on systems-a behavior not usually seen in previous ZeuS variants.
0.3434422787974500 In addition to the data theft and financial fraud Zeus is known for, PLXSert has discovered Zeus being used in crypto-currency mining, spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and attacks customized for specific PaaS and SaaS infrastructure.
0.0820507356844363 In addition, using RTF files to spread ZBOT is unusual, as it's typically spread via other means such as downloaders, malicious sites, or spam.
0.577565573986621 In an example analyzed by ThreatMetrix Labs, Zeus targets a major department store.
0.0677842579628756 In another series of targeted attacks, cybercriminals using the Zeus Trojan launched a campaign directed at employees responsible for accounting in small firms.
0.443477081529716 In contrast, ZeuS previously used modules that had to be included when the toolkit was sold.
0.625404366269303 In fact, it seems to want to swipe information of a very similar nature to a ZBot infection from August of 2012 detailed on the ShadowServer Blog ," GFI's Chris Boyd wrote in an anlysis of the attack.
0.1210427379247328 In fact, the great majority of them have never heard of things like zero-day vulnerabilities, botnets, Mini Flame or the Zeus Trojan (click on the screenshot to enlarge it):
0.1171253646876809 In February, another Zeus variant stole corporate data through a compromised system whose user had logged into the cloud service, according to Adallom.
0.252407012114037 In function it is similar to other "bankers" in the wild, especially Zbot.
0.3914943455901531 In late 2010, authorities in the United Kingdom and Ukraine arrested and detained several individuals for developing and profiting from custom versions of the ZeuS Trojan.
0.2592516242270219 In messages from 2009 to a Spamdot member named "Russso," Umbro declares flatly, "hi, I'm the author of Zeus.".
0.74990649773270 "In most of these cases Zeus activity was noticed after the initial infection.".
0.589192983597706 In my last post , I talked about some of the MITB attacks currently being used by modern banking trojans like URLZone and Zeus/Zbot.
0.1370617226083786 In order to create greater distinction we've seen a security company give a particular Zeus botnet another name when talking about it in the media.
0.361167854517776 In short, they are to PoS terminals what ZeuS, Citadel, and other banking trojans are to online bank accounts.
0.490884839395400 In some cases, the cadence of such automated activity can indicate the difference between a user attempting to crawl and download their Salesforce contact list using a script like Wget (insider threat), and a malicious crawler built into certain malware packages like Zeus (external threat).
0.3520409557191497 In the past months cyber criminals implemented an efficient commercial model for the distribution of the famous Zeus Trojan, the malware that is designed as an open project that can be customized with new features to meet customer demands.
0.4438959369272590 In the past, we've written about a ZeuS variant that might not infect slow computers as a result of aggressive anti-debugging techniques.
0.143710311278589 In the screen shot above, the ZeuS author can be seen selling surplus "installs," offering to rent hacked machines that fellow forum members can seed with their own spam bots (I have added a translation beneath each line).
0.747671315091837 In this case, the HTML of the bank login page is placed inside a virtual Russian doll, which provides a layer of obfuscation ZeuS is not currently prepared to handle.
0.326748883333852 In this most recent spam campaign, our spam traps caught an uncanny combination of a CapitalOne phish and a ZBOT variant.
0.295427415580340 In this particular case we had an interest of our own, since the ZeuS malware made a lot of Dutch victims as well.".
0.367785000711593 In this short blog post, I'm going to share just one of those techniques (using edit-distance) that you can plug into your multi-part system to perform rudimentary detection for popular crimeware admin panel strains like Pony, Citadel, and Zeus.
0.697508947068066 Indeed, injects are frequently sold on the underground for other criminals to integrate into their Zbot or Citadel crimeware..
0.512705378395127 injects can be found oftenly inside Zeus configs, it makes the webinjects more dynamic because most of the content is located remotely and can be updated much easily instead of sending new config to all the bots.
0.442747874481017 Instead, you must send a specially formed POST request to a certain address (which is actually a URL hardcoded into the bot in the same location as in ZeuS 2.0.8.9).
0.253664285211367 Is a simple, indiscriminate Zeus infection a noteworthy incident?
0.2905932273568455 It also borrows ZeuS's form-grabbing functionality and hooks the browser's HTTP POST function.
0.3530835362164085 It also creates a new registry key to make Zeus run every time the computer is restarted.
0.05680417710818841 It appears that the Zeus source code has been leaked almost in full - either due to a mishap of some sort, or intentionally exposed by its current owner - hacker and coder "Gribodemon"/ "Harderman".
0.515942449022544 "\ufeff\ufeffIt can be seen that AS33182 HostDime is ranked #1 due to a wide range of issues, including spam, exploit servers, phishing servers and Zeus servers as well as smaller concentrations of C&C servers, badware and infected Web sites," the report says.
0.612623480280262 It is also a good answer to popular community based domains blacklisting resources like Zeus tracker and Malware Domain List .
0.2102025354982928 It is believed to be a completely new family of malware, similar to but sufficiently distinct from, the Zeus malware.
0.3716104869796259 It is important to note that we are now seeing an increase of this malware, which can be attributed to UPATRE/ZBOT being distributed as attachments to spammed messages.
0.454583034056486 "It is not clear at this point in time if the same group of people are behind the whole operation, or if multiple gangs collaborated, perhaps with one to drive traffic to the exploit pack and sell the infected computers to another gang operating a botnet based on Win32/Zbot.".
0.1747695671375796 It is this very feature - code injection - that has made ZeuS such a potent weapon in defeating the security mechanisms that many commercial and retail banks use to authenticate their customers.
0.677739947049389 "It looks quite similar to the Zeus banking Trojan\u2026 This isn't a new class of malware.".
0.300426260240814 It turns out that many ZeuS banking trojan investigations were done by the (little known) Omaha (Nebraska, USA) office of the FBI.
0.694822170894539 It uses a different packer and contains sophisticated anti-debugging and anti-analysis routines, but underneath it's still ZeuS: it uses the same folders and file names, injects the same processes, creates the same registry entries, etcetera.
0.3817283729661069 It was actually a tweet back to a story from July 11th where Danielle Walker wrote ZBerp Evolves: Spreads through Phishing Campaign which was actually quoting the July 7th story from WebSense Labs, where Elad Sharf wrote Zeus PIF: The Evolving Strain Looking to Defeat Your Security Software .
0.535025134272278 It was moved among a number of IP addresses including one belonging to a legitimate Scottsdale business known as previous host to Ice IX malware and a Zeus control server with the domain brainrace.ru.
0.3387894248885884 It wasn't until the company hired an outside forensics expert who removed the hard drive and examined it in an isolated environment that the expert found the ZeuS infection.
0.2182836179225945 It's a back-end Web database designed to interact with a collection of Windows PCs infected by the ZeuS Trojan.
0.687041346720635 It's not the long-awaited Zeus for Mobile; it cannot sneak into mobile banking applications and listen in; it is not even designed to capture mobile browsing traffic.
0.771228751050403 It's somewhat bemusing to see that there is no honour between thieves, as Corkow's routines for web injection and form-grabbing appears to be based on the leaked Zeus source code.
0.341878899495151 It's the main difference with this, and a standard web inject inside Zeus.
0.215280104687565 I've taken 2 separate instances of 3 different "strains" of web-based crimeware (Pony, Citadel, and Zeus) from our malware repositories to demonstrate this technique.

0.772306541692526 KINS is the "ideal candidate" for cyber criminals in search of the next major banking trojan because it's commercially available, easy to use (much like Zeus) and is offered with technical support, Limor Kessem, a cyber crime and online fraud expert at RSA's FraudAction Research Lab, said in a Tuesday blog post.

0.060103759674308 The first P2P Zeus variant was uncovered by Trusteer firm a couple of years ago, it was used in a series of attacks against principal internet service providers and targeting users of popular web services including Facebook, Hotmail,Yahoo and Google Mail .
0.543805631733498 The first version of Citadel, a variant of banking trojan Zeus , entered the black market in January at cost of $2,399, but now commands a fee that is 41 percent higher \u2013 $3,391 for the latest, or sixth, Citadel release.
0.2081282432946243 "The first ZeuS in the Mobile attack showed us that cybercriminals continue to extend their activities into new platforms and target new areas (mTANs in this case).
0.723992116196298 The first Zeus mobile variant appeared in September of last year and aimed to trick users into downloading the malware through a warning about the need for a "certificate update.".
0.703520848267567 The former is similar to ZitMo - its main function is to intercept one-time passwords (transaction authorization numbers).
0.599645414569761 The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry is the same: C&C cell phone number, SMS commands, and the ability to forward SMS messages from a particular number, as well as the ability to change C&C. The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Android is far more primitive.
0.348842364655057 The gangs behind Gumblar, Zeus and other massive Web-based attacks have relied on browser-based exploits for much of their success, and experts say that these well-known attacks are just the ripples on the surface of what is a much larger sea of exploits targeting all of the major browsers.
0.234836816357143 The groups of attackers that employ the Zeus toolkit for their scams and malware campaigns have long used sites in the .ru Russian TLD as homes for their botnet controllers.

0.442855346755675 The latest variant of the Citadel malware - an offspring of the Zeus financial Trojan - attempts to steal a user's master passwords for two free and open source password tools - KeePass and Password Safe - as well as to compromise the neXus Personal Security Client, which some enterprises and service providers use to provide secure financial and e-commerce transactions.
0.2289154444098786 \ufffdThe latest Zeus variant catches victims off-guard by waiting to attack until after a website\ufffds login page appears to be functioning normally.
0.0680070282951450 The leak has echoes of the release of the Zeus crimeware source code a couple of years ago and has security researchers concerned that it may lead to a similar crop of new Trojans and crimeware kits.
0.4148084183891892 The links lead to malicious sites, which are instances of the Blackhole v2 exploit kit, and which ultimately lead to the download of a Zeus bot variant.
0.373497545536200 The links led to Blackhole exploits and a Zeus Trojan disguised as an Adobe Flash Player download.
0.783469921115445 The list from its configuration file seems longer than most of the typical of ZeuS variants and the domain names looked atypical.
0.668954890070720 The lure email emails used by Zeus PIF often hold subjects used to lure a target to run a file from a URL and according to the team are of good quality; containing no spelling mistakes and convincing imagery.
0.407078526136239 The magistrate was unswayed by evidence presented by Patco's lawyers that modern malware threats like ZeuS can modify content in the victim's browser (and thus prompt users for the answers to all of their secret questions).
0.593590439263974 The malicious file followed the same naming convention as the legitimate Opera auto update files but was much smaller: A number of Opera's estimated 300 million users may have been infected with a nasty Trojan downloader part of the Zbot family.
0.3826694819357716 "The malware also includes a basic ZeuS webinject template, but each customer in the ZeuS P2P CaaS can modify and add new advanced webinjects and increase the number of targets," Kruse said.
0.1071052933369257 The malware first emerged around September 2011 as the latest version of the Zeus malware.
0.1716154488954099 The malware is based on the leaked code of Zeus and RAM-scraping malware.
0.1061103133112467 The methods that Greko and Rothschild developed are based on their analysis of the infamous Zeus Trojan and the way that it exfiltrates data and communicates with its C&C servers.
0.68253305737991 The most active malicious banking program - both in terms of the number of attacks and in terms of the number of targeted users - is the Trojan Zbot (aka ZeuS).

0.486643720658864 The new variants are usually the result of rebuilding that can be carried out with minimum fuss using programs known as ZeuS Builder kits.
0.14255052324175 The "new" ZeuS is ultimately a matter of economics, according to Symantec Security Response director Kevin Haley.
0.721042980635487 The news is, some smart malware pimp managed to dupe a whole bunch of Anonymous supporters into installing the Zeus botnet - when they thought they were getting a DDoS tool.
0.33651128392102 The notorious banking Trojan emerged after the source code for the Zeus Trojan was leaked in 2011, and it employs a number of evasion tactics including the ability to detect files and processes used by virtualization software, make comparisons against known profiles of online sandboxes such as Anubis, or sleeping until recognizing what it interprets as human movements.
0.529729750940173 The notorious ZBot family of malware (also known as Zeus) can hijack your computer, making it part of a criminal botnet.
0.1139065080085864 The operators behind the malicious campaign used other malware to target their attacks against specific companies, the attackers used versions of Backdoor.Cyberat and Trojan.Zbot to infect systems with specific configurations.
0.662368085294384 The original Zbot used encryption in several places to make aspects of its operation harder to detect.
0.369290904750409 The paper finishes with the following prediction: 'they [attacks involving ZitMo] will become more specifically targeted against a smaller number of victims'.
0.0695933018114659 The particularity of Zeus is that it acts as a " man-in-the-browser " allowing cyber-crooks to collect personal information from its victims as well as to surreptitiously perform online transactions.
0.2493269971903735 The 'partner' program intercepts the victim's online banking credentials, and then it is up to ZitMo to obtain the one-time passwords used in online banking systems to authorize transactions and send them to cybercriminals, who will use the data to steal money from the victims' bank accounts.
0.2447181769749806 The payload of this threat is to install ZeuS variants onto user systems in order to steal sensitive information from users.
0.737611302911223 The popularity and pervasiveness of Zeus/Zbot has made it almost a synonym for banking malware, but there are unfortunately many more types of malicious software that allow attackers to steal money from their victims.
0.381086605637623 The post Facebook Zeus malware targeting bank accounts appeared first on Security Affairs .
0.416545776774332 The previous version of Zeus, version 2.0, also included several features that were less talked about such as: Victim's Address Book - One of the things Zeus does when it infects a machine is go to the "Protected Storage" and steal all the data from it.
0.2283139609357641 The Prolexic Security Engineering and Response Team (PLXSert) has released a threat advisory outlining new payloads from the Zeus toolkit that it has seen in the wild.
0.443869765719268 The proliferation of commercial banking thefts involving the ZeuS Trojan and other sophisticated attack tools underscores the asymmetry between the attackers and defenders.
0.725706309613466 The reality is that there are many, many different Zeus botnets all maintained by different cyber criminals.
0.305986015178238 The .reloc section contains some information needed by Zbot for some of its malicious activities.
0.696577148809852 The replacement of a Zeus client for the "Slowloris" DDoS tool took place on the day after Anonymous launched strikes against websites operated by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and others in retaliation for the arrest of four men associated with the popular Megaupload "cyberlocker" site on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.
0.322424281556992 The report, by security firm Trusteer, says firms like Nochex, a small-business centered online payment company, Web Money and Money Booker have all been the target of multiple Zeus variants - 26 in the case of Money Booker, a service that allows consumers to make online payments without the hindrance of having to disclose personal information.
0.18667006076199 The report cites several examples of such 'malicious actors', including a cyber criminal the FBI found last year who was selling a Zeus botnet Trojan and accepting Bitcoin as a payment and another incident in which a Lulzsec member used Bitcoin to purchase a botnet.
0.504287040671371 The report foresees 2011 being fraught with mobile device insecurities, particularly on iPhones and Android phones, as well as the further proliferation of the Zeus botnet. .
0.353846636464650 The researchers discovered that the image used by the Zeus variant is much larger of the original image found with a simple research made with Google because cybercriminals added additional data encrypted using Base64 encoding and then RC4 and XOR encryption algorithms.
0.279460565942657 The researchers noted another interesting detail, some of the Zeus parameters were hard-coded, and this and this suggests that discovered variant was used as a specially crafted tool in a larger attack.
0.746882726853486 The researchers then found crash reports akin to the POS malware used against Target and other retailers, mostly from a large clothing retailer in the Eastern U.S. "This was massively different from a normal Zeus infection.
0.3475329052555178 The rumors that the developers of Zeus - the world's most popular piece of crimeware - may soon shut down shop, spread like wildfire a few weeks ago in the fraud underground.
0.1392923297731214 The secondary file that is dropped is jiubl.exe , which we detect as TSPY_ZBOT.WCDA.
0.1070436696528055 The security firm adds that given the spread of the attack and its poor detection rates, it's "very hard for law enforcement agencies to investigate and mitigate," hinting that the module's creators may have collaborated with another group to popularize the exploit kit only to sell the infected computers to a group running a Win32/Zbot botnet.
0.4603876145869940 The security industry has monitored since its beginnings the evolution of the Zeus malware.
0.737860764277392 The servers and the domains hosted on them were allegedly being used to spread multiple Zeus botnets and collect key-logging data from infected computers, a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday.
0.438206899697614 The shield-ec scareware scam was unique because the purveyors pitched it as "the result of a two-year research collaboration of programmers and analysts from Martindale Enterprises and ZeusTracker, the main center for ZeuS epidemic prevention.".
0.1853678600246572 The source code leak also necessarily means that Zeus is now fully exposed to research, meaning that anyone using parts of the source code for their own Trojan creations will make it easier for malware researchers to analyze and reverse-engineer the code.
0.585530716812351 The source code to the infamous Zeus crimeware kit, which has been sold on underground forums for years, has been leaked and is now available for anyone to see if they know where to look.
0.1778330449912309 The spread of the banking mobile Trojans of ZitMo is especially frustrating, because they act in conjunction with the Trojans on PCs and allow a bypassing of two-step verification used by banks and payment services to prevent frauds.
0.795302823565434 The takedown effort appeared to have a substantial impact on the spread of Zeus as the foundation of cyber-criminals botnets: Attempts at infecting systems with Zeus fell by more than half to 336,000 for a single week in June, from 780,000 for a week in early March..
0.780444765619758 The takedown of some of the Zeus botnet's command and control (C&C) servers has been welcomed, but with a warning that the threat has not gone altogether.
0.2866995100672523 The top three detected malware family types were: ZeuS (banking trojan), Citadel (banking trojan), and Asprox (spambot).
0.1709172759539119 The upshot is clear: Shrugging off the threat posed by older malware ("But it's only a ZeuS infection\u2026") is not just risky.
0.725917584284329 The Wall Street Journal now reports that the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan is preparing to announce that 60 people have been charged in connection with a major ZeuS crime ring.
0.347539789174686 The ZBOT malware, detected as TSPY_ZBOT.TFZAH , downloads a JPEG file into the affected system without the user's knowledge.

0.286735486916798 The Zeus banking trojan and botnet has had a number of iterations over the years, particularly since the source code was leaked online.
0.718505753893378 "The Zeus family of malware is still the gold standard," says Dennis Schwarz (left), research analyst for Arbor Networks, a network security company based in Burlington, Mass., referring to the trojan horse botnet that came to light in 2007.
0.620955598327598 The Zeus malware's ability to attack Ceridian is part of the regular update cycle in the malware black market.

0.64264524483570 The Zeus Trojan detects the user\ufffds name and the pop-up window looks completely legitimate, stating \ufffdHello, (name).
0.49578616378163 The Zeus Trojan specifically focuses on financial institutions around the world with the aim of stealing money from banks.
0.786345941473999 The Zeus Trojan targets all major credit card company websites upon customer login.
0.2867340475509194 The Zeus variant uses web injects to steal a variety of information, including usernames and passwords, answers to security questions, debit and credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and driver's license numbers, Anton Ziukin, of SentinelOne, wrote in a Wednesday post .
0.488967953230699 The Zeus variants in the campaign appear to also be using droppers which employ the hidden Windows 'PIF' (Program Information Files) file extension -- an extension the researchers say was often associated with viruses in the past and appears to be making a comeback.
0.2263891209563545 The Zeus / Zbot Trojan has been around since 2007, and it and its variants continued to perform MitM attacks, log keystrokes and grab information entered in online forms.
0.717375849336062 The ZeuS/ZBOT botnet has been entrenched in the cyber-crime business for a long time now and has continuously evolved and improved.
0.4165712313096686 The ZeuS/ZBOT malware continues to uphold its notorious reputation.
0.2884806175047368 The ZIP file contains an EXE (a program file); that program file is one of the many variants of the Zbot malware, also known as Zeus , that we see on a regular basis.
0.1593915638345546 Then, ZBOT was being downloaded onto the system; today the ZBOT code is dropped directly onto the affected system.
0.68336505887344 There are a number of established and relatively inexpensive services in the criminal underground that will sell individual ZeuS binaries to help novice hackers set up and establish ZeuS botnets (some will even sell you the bulletproof hosting and related amenities as part of a package), for a fraction of the price of the full ZeuS kit.
0.2183195473414912 "There are different types of programs, but all of them contain valuable private information that cybercriminals would love to steal-login credentials, certificates and so on," Tarakanov said, adding that Zeus also logs keystrokes pre- and post-encryption.
0.435917529775497 There is a cast of characters that we know pretty well, including Zeus trojan horse, the W32.
0.2397866832284861 There were no major improvements compared to ZeuS 2.0.8.9 - the version which became publicly available.
0.0701740810011913 There were no 'newcomers' in the financial malware segment which could have an impact comparable to that of Zbot and Qhost.
0.304555435415258 These are the Trojan "families" such as Zeus, which has spun off Citadel and other variants.
0.343225374094487 These botnets were created from the famous Zeus toolkit.
0.487113907215242 These data are alarming, if we compare these losses to the economic impact of the Zeus Botnet as explained in the paper:"Consider: this means that cybercriminals in a single city, within six-months, equaled all the losses from Zbot up to the present," Trend Micro senior threat researcher Ryan Flores pointed out .
0.258751114756055 These new ZBOT variants intercept the information users enter into a bank's Web page by inserting predefined JavaScript code into the Web page.
0.3652229570185725 These reports talk about "the Zeus botnet", which is an inaccurate reflection of reality.
0.360420889938706 These samples were analyzed for differences from the original ZeuS samples used as the basis for the Ice IX bot.
0.0758982739360843 These ZBOT versions modify the Windows hosts file to prevent users from accessing security-related websites.
0.287680021170319 These ZeuS variants can specifically use mobile malware to defeat systems that rely on text messages sent via mobile phones on Symbian OSs.
0.793967652634396 They also acknowledged in their chats that they'd been in direct contact with the Zeus author himself - and that the gang had hired the malware author to code a custom version of the Trojan that would latter become known as "Jabberzeus."
0.1203016786731804 They are either standalone software, or are "modularised" and integrated with existing malware, like prevalent banking Trojan Zeus.
0.2971826249941149 They are the start of a new trend - naming vulnerabilities like researchers name malware (i.e. Zeus, Pony, etc.).
0.596577254046163 They introduced new features like Tor and I2P that Zeus and other botnets never used," Khandhar said.
0.598394511185268 They often download the notorious ZeuS/Zbot to users' computers.
0.430463924411655 They suspected him of being behind a botnet based on the notorious ZeuS .
0.496398064862074 They took advantage of ZeuS's popularity and leaked source code to create their own versions.
0.4811181275684953 This attachment was, however, an executable file designed to retrieve Zeus on their systems.
0.3608909324128538 This cyberheist mirrors attacks against dozens of other businesses over the past five years that have lost tens of millions of dollars at the hands of crooks armed with powerful banking Trojans such as ZeuS.
0.389626128214837 This entices the users to input more credentials than required, which is captured by the bot and posted back to the Zeus bot masters command & control server.
0.613751066373909 This functionality of certain ZBOT variants was reported as early as 2010 , effectively creating a remote-control capability for these malware, similar to how a backdoor controls an infected system.
0.1062294521506944 This identifier is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm (which ZeuS uses all the time to encrypt data) in combination with an S-box that is also hardcoded into the bot.
0.06161088563606742 This is a huge list , I rarely see even bot herders behind Zbot targeting so many banks.
0.775655917044767 This is due to its peer-to-peer connection to its command and control (C&C) server as compared to other ZeuS variants (such as IceIX, Citadel and KINS) that employed centralized C&C servers.
0.622799391971637 "This malicious page harbors the BlackHole exploit kit (we got served with the sample via a PDF file rigged with the CVE-2010-0188 exploit) that will infect the unlucky user with a freshly-compiled variant of ZBot, detected by Bitdefender as Trojan.Zbot.HXT," "The ZBot malware is on a server in Russia which, most probably, has also fallen victim to a hacking attack, allowing unauthorized access via FTP."
0.47206892878268 This one is none other than the infamous Zeus/Zbot banking Trojan which we blogged about a few months back.
0.1797879026708858 "This one is very similar to Zeus as far as effectiveness," said Jeremy Demar, Senior Threat Analyst, Damballa. "Zeus' primary communications method was peer-to-peer. If it's in a corporate environment that blocks peer-to-peer, it falls back to DGA. This is very similar in capabilities and effectiveness."
0.768212929953264 This panel, like others used in tandem with ZeuS (for example, Jabberzeus ) also is set up to alert the botmaster via Jabber instant message when a new set of credentials is stolen.
0.327972373348604 This particular list is from a ZeuS variant detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_ZBOT.BVQ.
0.2086513885911270 This particular zeus variant is known for rapidly changing its CnCs.
0.686714795742683 This remind me the guys who announced IceIX on malware forums and finally the samples was just a basic ZeuS with broken improvements.
0.2340549730866540 This week we discovered a large malware spam campaign that used the Zbot Trojan executable.
0.640486041513137 This would not be the first time something like this has happened, which we've witnessed in other cases involving Zeus and Citadel; however, it is not very likely in this case since Bugat and GOZ are essentially competitors, while Zeus and Citadel are closely related.
0.207195783741320 This ZBOT variant is detected as TSPY_ZBOT.KVV ; t his variant has the capability to steal user names and passwords such as from various sources such as email, FTP and online banking.
0.467578423832362 This Zeus variant also injects mule account data with the correct field names instead of the altered fields.

0.59757413811352 Three worms - one functioning as a malware downloader, one as redirector to fraudulent sites, and the third one as email harvester and backdoor - have also made the list, as well as a variant of the Zeus banking Trojan.
0.2645385874755953 Through its research, CSIS also reported today a key piece of evidence that shows the malware is looking to make a splash of its own compared to Zeus.
0.567551031471332 To a heuristic scanner, this changes the appearance of the file and lowers the possibility of detection: In addition, TSPY_ZBOT.BYZ is compressed somewhat differently from other ZeuS 2.0 variants.
0.4216418873501780 To all victims of Zeus it is suggested to change the passwords for online banking accounts and if user has carried bought using credit card while his machine was infected by Zeus Trojan it is necessary to inform the bank.
0.201729410040943 To deliver the Zeus variant via phony browser alerts, the attacker first sends out phishing emails through compromised email accounts, a PhishLabs post indicates.

0.620050790720437 Amongst the many interesting sections of the report is a discusson of the notorious Blackhole exploit kit, which we have written about frequently on Naked Security..
0.353463935230161 An out-of-the-blue tweet from a Dutch researcher kicked off an unprecedented 24-hour rumor mill yesterday concerning the arrest of Paunch, a hacker allegedly behind the notorious Blackhole Exploit Kit.
0.155677445678670 and because Blackhole has an updatable framework and already has a foothold on thousands of sites, we anticipate that the number of sites compromised with this new zero-day will escalate rapidly in the coming days," he Malware peddlers have also begun their efforts to drive traffic to those domains, as witnessed by a slew of emails purportedly coming from the Dutch branch of the accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward, trying to trick people into following the offered link with news that the VAT rate will increase starting on October 1, 2012.
0.553253113932750 And obviously, the overlap we've seen for a while now too, the exploits work their way from zero-day targeted attacks, and then turn around a few weeks later and that same exploit is now in BlackHole exploit kit.
0.0712972438658792 And the exploit is expected to show up if it hasn't already in the widely used BlackHole exploit toolkit, one of the most popular threats on the web.
0.1387900545044792 And then, for the finishing blow, the applicants receive a positive response from "NATO", informing them that they are invited to "contact Director of training institute via email: ( ) are responding to the same IPs that a number of fake domains (meant to impersonate PayPal, the FBI, eBay, and others) are, and all are redirecting to sites hosting the Blackhole exploit kit and other client side exploits.
0.3970734253447283 And when we checked out Cool's Flash exploits, we can't help but notice that it uses the same Flash filenames as seen from Blackhole version 1, which happen to exploit the same Flash vulnerabilities ( CVE-2011-0559 , CVE-2011-2110 , CVE-2011-0611 ).

0.598565255115948 As demonstrated in the Trend Micro report " Continuous Monitoring in a Virtual Environment ," traditional cybersecurity tools such as antivirus software may no longer be sufficient to beat back the rising tide of APTs, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware such as CryptoLocker and modularized malware such as FLAME and the BlackHole exploit kit.
0.517843993411520 As for Blackhole, there are still a handful of attack groups using it, but Kafeine said that he has seen about a 98 percent drop in the usage of that exploit kit since the arrest of Paunch.

0.173150105886042 However, Oracle quickly came to the fore with a fix in this case, a boon considering that the exploit was published on Hacker share-site Metasploit and added to the widely-used BlackHole exploit kit ..
0.2042370886861034 However, Sweet Orange has also disappeared but in October 2013, shortly after the arrest of Paunch, the author of BlackHole , experts observed a major increase in the use of Sweet Orange.
0.508403912918542 However, we have no evidence to suggest that this campaign is related to Blackhole rather than an example of code reuse.
0.1279223763720093 I predict that by the middle of 2014 we will see a new and more powerful exploit kit that possesses similar traits to BlackHole and will either be very cheap for cyber criminals to purchase or be leaked to the underground community to use for free.
0.313896920552017 I spoke briefly via instant message with the developer of this Blackhole kit (pictured at right), and he assured me that these images were taken from a working installation.
0.306109623012972 I would argue that Blackhole was perhaps the most important driving force behind an explosion of cyber fraud over the past three years.
0.544451522434271 id=122828 Looks like an active blackhole exploit kit, and someone was looking at this a little over an hour before I was.
0.539298743657246 If it is successful in logging in, it adds code for Blackhole Exploit Kit redirection pages to the blog.
0.2717056475317616 If that happens, it may not be long before this becomes a much bigger problem; Blackhole is by far the most prevalent exploit kit in use today.
0.709029094546686 If the browser is detected as Internet Explorer or Firefox, then Blackhole executes its normal payload, attempting to exploit any number of Reader, Java, or Internet Explorer vulnerabilities.
0.525967084127175 "If the location or URL for the iframe, which actually contains the malicious code, changes or is taken down, all of the compromised sites will have to be updated to point to this new location," Symantec's researchers "To deal with this, the Blackhole JavaScript code on compromised sites now dynamically generates pseudo-random domains based on the date and other information, and then creates an iframe pointing to the generated domain."
0.663533660456032 In addition to the familiar Blackhole Exploit Kit, we saw new ones like Whitehole and Cool emerge as well.
0.631689211456437 In August, Java was blasted as an unsafe plug-in that should only be used when absolutely necessary after a zero-day exploit was discovered, rolled into the user-friendly Blackhole exploit kit and used for nearly a week before Oracle issued a patch.
0.46430202556571 In conclusion, it is clear that this new generation of Blackhole Exploit Kit puts a lot of effort into new evasion techniques that are aimed towards making the lives of security researchers as difficult as they can be while taking the focus off obfuscation techniques, which used to be the main theme in exploit kit updates in the past. .
0.2048063784305188 In early October, law enforcement arrested the creator of the BlackHole Exploit Kit, "Paunch", and since then, the use of BlackHole has steadily decreased.

0.4291881401156022 Thanks to fellow SpiderLabs colleague Daniel Chechik for his input and for wandering into this particular Blackhole kit.
0.712360617814538 The advert for BlackHole 2.0 was spotted on the underground forum site Exploit.ln, and was translated from Russian with the help of Google Translate by the Malware Don't Need Coffee blog team..
0.47754600053413 The Angler kit is a recent tool appeared in the underground as condequence of the arrest for the alleged creator of Blackhole exploit kit .
0.468524851884796 The arrest of alleged hacker Paunch and the subsequent dismantling of the Blackhole Exploit Kit operation has cybercrime groups scrambling to find another automated means of delivering exploits.
0.50048748645781 The arrest of Paunch and the demise of Blackhole certainly had a dramatic effect on cybercrime incidents - but it was only a temporary effect.
0.629933361050531 The author of Blackhole, an exploit kit that booby-traps hacked Web sites to serve malware, has done so well for himself renting his creation to miscreants that the software has emerged as perhaps the most notorious and ubiquitous crimeware product in the Underweb.
0.761043855261780 The author of Blackhole is known by the handle Paunch.
0.551363366036108 The author of the Blackhole exploit kit seems to be more comfortable as a system integrator and web application developer than anything else, and is far from being hardcore vulnerability researcher..
0.0711638227319274 The author of the popular Blackhole exploit kit, also know as Paunch, has been arrested.
0.1555372940698852 The Black Hole exploit kit works mainly by controlling user web traffic with various techniques.
0.586825162648768 The Blackhole business model may become the common model, since it works pretty well for the sellers.
0.69994063741399 The Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) spam run has already assumed various disguises during its course.
0.582872922019760 The Blackhole Exploit Kit first reared its ugly head in late 2010, and quickly became a common find for malware researchers investigating compromised websites, and responsible for most of the web attacks that were seen.
0.0697435034731228 The Blackhole exploit kit is a framework for delivering exploits via compromised or third-party websites, serve up a range of old and new exploits for Oracle's Java, Adobe's Flash and other popular software to take control of victim's machines.
0.0638237217719068 The Blackhole exploit kit is a popular and prevalent exploit kit using new zero day and known exploits, to take control of your system when you visit a site that is comprised and infected by the Blackhole kit.
0.719739077369300 The Blackhole exploit kit is fair with the individual exploit functions and doesn't favour any single one of them...
0.35139903229501 The Blackhole Exploit Kit is one of the most notorious exploit kits currently in circulation among the cybercriminal underground today.
0.44635208346305 The Blackhole Exploit Kit may have met its demise, but this hasn't deterred cybercriminals from using other exploit kits for their schemes.
0.3539965035222123 The bot code, generated by the crimeware kit's "builder" component, typically is distributed via social engineering attacks in email and social networking sites, or is foisted by an exploit pack like Eleonore or Blackhole, which use hacked Web sites and browser flaws to quietly install the malware.
0.61261501149065 The campaign itself is pretty standard: users are redirected to websites hosting the BlackHole exploit kit, which takes advantage of a browser or plugin vulnerability to install a piece of ransomware on their computers.
0.527416882100635 The creator of the BlackHole exploit kit has added an exploit for it, as well, and that kit is used by a wide range of attackers.
0.561326780391071 The developer of the toolkit, who goes by the handle "Paunch," recently announced the availability of Blackhole 2.0, which removes much of its trove of known and patched exploits, and replaces them with a whole new crop-along with features that will make it harder for antivirus companies and site owners to detect trouble..
0.2183863382145987 The fall of the Blackhole Exploit Kit in 2013 due to the arrest of its creator, Paunch, was a significant event that appreciably changed the threat landscape.
0.672353333090933 The first is CVE-2013-0422, a Java vulnerability that last week had already made its way into exploit kits such as Nuclear and Blackhole.
0.1564346221515581 The following table includes the dates of activity and some of the new organizations being spoofed by Black Hole Exploit Kit spammers: Below is the infection chain for the Black Hole Exploit Kit spam run that spoofed Amazon, AT&T, and PayPal which is just an example of the massive spam runs our experts track and release solutions for as the attacks occur: As this activity continues, we will continue to track and ensure that solutions for these runs remain effective and release updated solutions as necessary.
0.3248522097214958 The infection source is spam redirected into some redirector pages to be forwarded to the landing page of the most popular exploit kit, Blackhole, at the eziponoma.ru:8080.
0.381984889454309 The kit also lacks operational security features which would make the campaigns harder to detect and analyze, so it definitely can't compete with the Blackhole exploit kit.
0.590349786925869 The kit's developers continuously update Blackhole's exploit capabilities, which center on Java vulnerabilities, but Sophos says that many computers continue to have older vulnerabilities because of haphazard Java patch installation.
0.290299648554688 The landing page appears similar to that of Blackhole.
0.73235916992619 The landing pages are different in all the attacks, but some look like they could have been set up since the recent advent of the new version of the Blackhole exploit kit ..
0.2447840574454912 The last info I have was from a year ago, when Blackhole protection was restricted to be used on 28 servers.
0.067136164358158 The latest of these is a notification alert about "activity you may have missed on Facebook": Clicking on any of the offered buttons or the "unsubscribe" link ultimately lands users on a page hosting the Blackhole exploit kit serving an exploit for Adobe Reader and Acrobat.
0.502800989903507 The links are legitimate compromised websites redirecting to the Blackhole exploit server.

0.662009717652254 Damballa CTO Brian Foster said that too many retailers are still relying on traditional antivirus technologies to keep POS systems safe, even though the DHS advisory suggested a number of additional precautions, including securing the remote desktop applications being used by attackers to spread Backoff and configuring firewalls to accept communications from only known IP addresses and ports.
0.786906973169357 Damballa pointed out that Backoff had remained hidden and was active in networks after bypassing network prevention controls.
0.42999952497882 Earlier this year, the U.S. Secret Service issued an advisory that a point-of-sale malware strain known as "Backoff" had struck more than 1,000 U.S. companies since Oct. 2013.
0.456698866317089 Earlier this year, Trend Micro published a paper detailing many different PoS RAM scrapers , including BackOff.
0.153530396377706 Even more concerning than the growing victim tally is the fact that bad actors launched Backoff in October 2013, which means that some enterprises have been infected with the malware for many months without knowing.
0.1617384822806282 Even now, companies are still in the position of having to actively search for Backoff on their systems, prompting the additional warning from the Feds.
0.4768188261408994 Even with the DHS warning, which included instructions for retailers on how to mitigate Backoff, Damballa found that infections rose a further 27% from the beginning until the end of September.

0.4573852545481388 Foster noted that the retail industry's response to Backoff is especially worrying ahead of the U.S. holiday shopping period , which is the most lucrative period of the year for those companies, but not if they are attacked like Target was in 2013.
0.662122351990466 Greg Martin, CTO of Redwood City, California-based vendor Threatstream, said that Backoff is one of the more active strains of malware targeting point-of-sale systems, and that more companies have likely been victimized and have either yet to discover a breach or haven't publically announced details.
0.692305021498438 Having risen to infamy after the massive Target breach last year, Backoff continues...
0.243909575491260 Henderson and Byrne also talked about how allowing software to be able to run on POS systems only opens the door for devices to be infected with malware, such as Backoff and - more recently - Punkey .

0.661207147837322 Hong Kei Chan, a junior antivirus analyst with the firm said that like Backoff, ROM can extract Track 1 and Track 2 data from PoS terminals, and that it has a sophisticated approach when it comes to parsing that information.
0.64294727558233 How can companies protect against Backoff malware?
0.629214621715349 If that is the case, Home Depot may be among the more than 1,000 U.S. businesses that the U.S. government recently warned had been victimized by the Backoff point-of-sale malware campaign .
0.594196483659746 If that's true, it wouldn't come as a huge surprise, given that some noted security experts believe the Backoff victim count will far exceed the initial estimate of 1000, and could even climb over 10,000 when the dust finally settles.
0.3494617041608286 In a press release detailing the investigation's findings, Dairy Queen included a list of the locations hit as well as the time periods that Backoff was present on their systems, which varied by location.
0.111342562056270 In a security advisory from the US Secret Service dated 22 August 2014, obtained by the New York Times, the government said the malware known as Backoff has struck more than 1000 US companies since October 2013.

0.614771626518970 It is believed that Backoff may have been responsible for breaches impacting Target , as well as those more recently disclosed by UPS and SUPERVALU .
0.4816488297479545 It's the flavor of the month, apparently, as Dairy Queen announces that it, too, has been compromised by Backoff point-of-sale (POS) malware.
0.3289799312583160 Josh Grunzweig, a malware research with Trustwave Spiderlabs, a contributor to the Department of Homeland Security report, said in a blog post that while none of Backoff's features should be consider "innovative," that doesn't mean it should be ignored.

0.085885656675173 McAfee Labs has recently come across a number of malware samples that drop Zbot and Necurs rootkits.
0.738077511167629 Necurs found on more than 83,000 machines; Microsoft report callls rootkit a "prevalent threat".
0.370173095504559 Necurs is a kernel mode driver best known at the moment for being used by Gameover Zeus (GOZ) to hinder attempts to detect and remove the malware.
0.694926969712096 Necurs listens for a total of 15 different IoControlCodes, including:

0.4918161714662645 The code for this rootkit comes from another notorious malware family known as Necurs .
0.650139598552786 The Necurs driver's design is interesting in that it doesn't require any changes by the authors for use by a third party.
0.603798151243713 The Necurs rootkit can be removed using Rootkit Remover .
0.2970330841263374 The polivalent Necurs malware family has been wreaking havoc in November by infecting over 83,000 unique computers - and that are only the ones detected by Microsoft's solutions!
0.745832163708891 The report discusses malicious use of cryptocurrency and warns that the domain .bit (which is used by the Necurs malware ) is "much more dangerous" because it is impossible to sinkhole domains on that server.
0.0723842476639279 The ZeuS variant that UPATRE downloads, also downloads another malware NECURS.
0.64580300648509 These features essentially make the Necurs driver well suited for resale and use by third parties, as is evident by its use in the GOZ trojan.
0.1816329806159092 This ZBOT variant then downloads a NECURS variant detected as RTKT_NECURS.RBC .
0.483728969619672 We can see that the code first checks to see if the Necurs device object NtSecureSys already exists:
0.67365738312560 We don't know for sure - perhaps the the two groups are joining forces, or perhaps the Necurs source code has been acquired by the Gameover gang.
0.4786257429831740 "A lot of time researchers will classify a certain piece of malware and say 'We've got it!' and file it off in a shelf and not really study it," he says. "That kind of approach wouldn't really have worked with NotCompatible. A researcher may have written it off when they first discovered it because it was just a proxy server and didn't seem to be doing that much damage. But studying it for years showed how sophisticated this network did become."
0.0679589732191395 A new threat in the second quarter, dubbed NotCompatible after one of the C2 domains, acts as a proxy that gives the attacker access to networks accessible by the mobile device.
0.0875947300874895 According to Linden, the rise in NotCompatible is a good lesson that security researchers should pay more attention to mobile threats over longer periods of time.
0.522847745217812 Additionally, NotCompatible utilizes peer-to-peer communication between the nodes for added resiliency.

0.4221937594010777 As we see in the preceding images, NotCompatible will automatically start at boot.
0.2524047652488692 "Based on our current research, NotCompatible is a new Android trojan that appears to serve as a simple TCP relay/proxy while posing as a system update," the advisory stated.
0.634017296335723 Based on our previous analysis, we conclude that NotCompatible is an unusual Android malware delivered to users using a drive-by attack that could represent a proof of concept for a targeted attack.
0.255535952020251 Based on some Googling, this appears to be the malware usually called "NotCompatible" and which comes in a file named update.apk.
0.3798244526752253 Beyond NotCompatible, the report found TowelRoot and TowelExploit, root exploit malware, and BasicSystemSpy, a surveillance malware, to be the most pressing concern to U.S. enterprises.
0.2552949406947484 Details of the malware - dubbed NotCompatible.C - were published by Lookout in a report released today.
0.582195872000117 In addition, NotCompatible.C's traffic is encrypted, meaning that any enterprise or network-based security system can't block C&C traffic, and can't identify it because it's encrypted.
0.745320745971256 Lookout's Kevin Mahaffey told Infosecurity that early iterations of the NotCompatible threat emerged in 2012, distributed via hacked websites or spam campaigns that turned mobile devices into a proxy, allowing hackers to bounce traffic through them.
0.513877383989386 Mobile security firm Lookout has discovered a more sophisticated variant of the NotCompatible Android botnet which it says targets enterprise networks through compromised mobile devices.
0.0559682436233555 Most threatening to enterprises was the "NotCompatible" trojan, which could allow attackers to compromise secure corporate networks.
0.730382242579669 NotCompatible uses the New I/O Proxy API implementation, which is a low-level API that provides access to intensive input/output operations.
0.611964792490634 NotCompatible.C works by giving attackers access to any network a compromised device is connected to, including corporate Wi-Fi and VPNs.
0.3206337257309157 That's not anything new, but what makes this threat different is the level of sophistication in the backend of NotCompatible to resist reverse engineering and takedown efforts by the security community.
0.0668361941548355 The malware, dubbed NotCompatible, is being transmitted by websites when they're accessed on smartphones running Google's Android operating system.
0.2125319631254779 The NotCompatible mobile malware reportedly has a new variant called, NotCompatible.C, which one security firm...
0.2067102484209927 The NotCompatible Trojan emerged as a new threat in the second quarter of 2012.
0.560857892399191 "They (the trojan's creators) really rebuilt this whole software under the hood in late 2013 into late 2014," he said. "They started incorporating features like peer-to-peer communication. We also saw a large increase in the detections of NotCompatible and saw it pushed out on a campaign-based basis."
0.789297379447806 "To date we haven't seen another mobile botnet that's nearly as sophisticated and definitely not as long-lived as NotCompatible.".
0.385953766164849 We also saw a large increase in the detections of NotCompatible and saw it pushed out on a campaign-based basis.".
0.371259206877656 [1] We uncovered a bug that impacts all Linux platforms, including mobile devices, and we're calling it "grinch."
0.3178886405082660 Alert Logic claimed that an attacker could exploit grinch through the use of a third-party Linux software framework called Policy Kit (Polkit), which was designed to aid users in installing and running software packages.
0.540656031756186 Bash related vulnerabilities like the Grinch, are primarily a problem to retailers and e-commerce platforms like Amazon, who tend to favor Unix/Linus based operating systems.
0.4864278935627840 But this is no Heartbleed or Shellshock moment: Grinch doesn't pose an imminent threat, security experts say, but it should serve as a wakeup call for how Linux systems are configured.
0.505626330335246 Grinch is not remotely exploitable; it requires that an attacker have physical access the server they want to attack.
0.2023973331790350 Grinch technically resides in the new Linux authorization system that allows privilege escalation through Wheel, the firm revealed in its blog.
0.584325862968937 In an interview with SCMagazine.com, Stephen Coty, director of threat research at Alert Logic, said that, simply put, "anything that is set up by the Linux default settings would be affected" by grinch.
0.538199732715980 In other words, grinch doesn't have the wide attack surface of Shellshock , which relied on the Bash shell found in nearly all Linux distributions.
0.1843999823740365 More importantly, understanding how your Linux system work will go a long way in tackling a bug like Grinch.
0.1365303197758059 Other security experts have also downplayed grinch.
0.4548688341051354 Security researchers uncover 'grinch' vulnerability that could affect all Linux systems.
0.177553556970329 Some smartphone running on Linux related OS could also be vulnerable to the Grinch bug.
0.677985043226186 The Grinch vulnerability, affecting all Linux based operating system potentially gives an attacker root access to a system according to Alert Logic who announced the Bug on Tuesday.
0.757153553236292 We dove further into the Linux platform and discovered grinch, which exists in the new authorization system that allows privilege escalation through wheel.
0.770423433401078 "We find that possession of user logs and knowledge of your own environment are the best security content to help you navigate away from a bug like grinch.

0.603910223480144 A comprehensive analysis of the version of BlackEnergy circulating at the time was done in 2007 by Arbor Networks.
0.330559036264287 According to a report issued by ESET, the new varian has been found targeting more than 100 government and industry organizations in Poland and the Ukraine , and other attacks based on BlackEnergy hit a target in Brussels, Belgium, as reported by F-Secure.
0.310886648293491 According to CyberX, its analysis of several BlackEnergy samples strongly indicates that data theft is the primary motive.
0.721356139636635 According to Sullivan BlackEnergy LITE is only the last discovery for Russian malware, let's remind the CosmicDuke and Havex cases, however the BlackEnergy campaigns "might be a little less profit-motivated and more patriotically motivated" .

0.2166475560726219 A "Masque Attack," however, can't replace Apple's platform applications, such as Mobile Safari, but it can replace applications installed from the App Store.
0.600774966016153 Apple is facing Masque Attack II, a major vulnerability that allows malicious apps to leverage existing, legitimate ones to spread malware.
0.198924445203416 Dubbed a "Masque Attack" by the FireEye researchers who discovered this technique this summer, the attack was described publicly for the first time in a report today .

0.2214126307376630 In November of last year, we uncovered a major flaw in iOS we dubbed " Masque Attack " that allowed for malicious apps to replace existing, legitimate ones on an iOS device via SMS, email, or web browsing.
0.584459112318789 iOS Masque Attack revived: Bypassing Prompt for Trust and App URL scheme hijacking.
0.588801508562234 Perhaps what makes Masque Attack more of a real threat is that enterprise provisioning is currently being used by third-party app sites, especially those based in China.
0.284917544259674 Researchers at network threat prevention company FireEye have uncovered a revived iOS Masque Attack, a vulnerability that originally surfaced in November 2014.
0.560097727522765 Security researchers found that the Masque attack works on Apple's mobile operating system including iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and the 8.1.1 beta version and that all of the iPhones and iPads running iOS 7 or later, regardless of whether or not the device is jailbroken are at risk.
0.596241006373425 The first Masque Attack, uncovered in November , allowed miscreants to steal user data from app caches, but FireEye explains that Masque Attack II give hackers the means to bypass the iOS prompt for trust and carry out app URL scheme hijacking which could lead to phishing attacks, a Thursday blog post explained.
0.2028288194424471 The "Masque Attack" exploits a system Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through the App Store, David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout, tells Reuters .
0.56914507564678 Unlike the first variation of the Masque attack, this iteration includes iOS URL scheme hijacking, which allows it to be propagated directly through the App Store.
0.422593588914235 Using the "Masque Attack," an attacker can replace authentic apps, such as banking and e-mail applications, using malware through the Internet, FireEye says.
0.459215148112155 We describe these two parts of Masque Attack II in the following sections.
0.388886878405507 While they seem to have successfully deflected responsibility for the Celebgate celebrity photo leak by blaming their users (who could expect Apple to block an attack using methods from a decade ago?), now hackers have outsmarted Apple again with the Masque Attack which allows hackers to bypass iOS security protections against malicious apps simply by giving their malware the same name as an already approved safe application.

0.3199869656001913 All told, around 2 million PCs were infected with the MyDoom virus, especially since the malware used the contact list to expand its reach to the victim's family, friends and colleagues.
0.54305067461748 At its peak, MyDoom reached an infection rate of 1 in every 12 e-mails.
0.1197935626238014 But then commonly discovered examples of Windows malware encountered at the time either, like the MyDoom or Sobig, also required manual intervention (the user clicking on a file attachment).
0.362201161938484 For example, the Mydoom worm spreads via an email attachment which, if opened, creates a backdoor on port 3127 to allow remote control of the infected PC.
0.736829974302545 "MyDoom contained the text 'andy; I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry,' which led many to believe that the virus was constructed for a fee for a spammer, though this also was not confirmed," Menegaz wrote.
0.288259643812730 Mydoom executed Distributed Denial-of-Service attack on one particular website and opened a backdoor on infected computers, which left the machine open to remote access.

0.2006122159194423 Now researchers have identified a new variant of the Cridex malware that has adopted some of the techniques that made GOZ so successful in its day.
0.627219673919928 Raff said it is unclear where the credentials used in the new campaign came from, though it is likely they were stolen during attacks using the older Cridex version.
0.4962709639805593 There is no definitive information on where the 50,000 stolen credentials came from, but Cridex is the suspected culprit, he said.
0.599131845344204 9FB4DD1B3E0B Malwarebytes : Trojan.Agent.ED Ikarus : Worm.Win32.Cridex Fortinet : W32/Kryptik.ASU!
0.457043917215155 A variant of the Cridex malware, called Geodo, steals data from compromised machines and comes with a self-replicating feature built from a list of 50,000 stolen SMTP credentials.
0.0646944156429234 Another difference between the two is that Cridex is usually spread with the help of exploit kits.
0.734979451926435 But the HTML injections and scripts as well as the structure of the attack used by Bugat to target banking applications are what IBM calls "GOZ-like"-and therefore very dangerous.
0.1183927675563635 Cridex traditionally had been known to spread via removable drives, but newer versions of the malware began arriving via Blackhole exploit kits, according to Trend Micro.

0.576306282739950 Geodo, a new version of the infamous Cridex (also known as Feodo or Bugat) banking information stealing Trojan works in conjunction with a worm that sends out emails automatically to continue its self-spreading infection method,
0.424591918743159 He added, "The second and more likely explanation is that the Bugat team could have analyzed and perhaps reversed the GOZ malware before copying the HTML injections that made GOZ so highly profitable for its operators.".
0.763074051498657 If you aren't careful about keeping your software and OS updates, chances are that the exploit kit will find a security vulnerability to take advantage of and will download and execute the Cridex Trojan - a piece of banking malware that also opens a backdoor on the target computer.
0.690538393255845 If you follow us in our previous blog posts --> >[HERE] about Cridex & its PWS Stealer, then you'll know that we follow this stealer in a kind of man-to-man marking, today we saw the changes in the payload as following details:

0.153246348556442 Now, researchers at IBM's X-Force research team have seen a new version of Cridex, which is also known as Bugat and Feodo, using some of the same techniques that GOZ used to such good effect.
0.31094668208064 Recent efforts by our Research Lab has revealed new activity related to Cridex.

0.1200659747748965 CoinVault doesn't vary much from traditional attacks in that it requests victims use bitcoins to recover their files, and if no payment is received within 24 hours, the ransom increases.
0.792633638368244 CoinVault, or TROJ_CRYPTCOIN.AK stands out from other variants because it offers users a rare opportunity: the chance to save one encrypted file.
0.2420327308169122 CryptoLocker , CoinVault , and TeslaCrypt are the names of some of the most dreaded ransomware that infected million of users worldwide.
0.1587121178838024 Even though the cybercriminals packaged CoinVault with this "freebie" offer, it's still best to take preventive measures against threats that hold your files for ransom.
0.658532585409897 Kaspersky Lab, in cooperation with the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands and the Netherlands National Prosecutors Office, recently made available tool that helps recover files lost to the CoinVault ransomware .
0.537748725749249 Kaspersky, which teamed up with Dutch law enforcement authorities in the CoinVault attacks, obtained access to the private keys from the attackers and offers CoinVault victims who are locked out of their data access to their confiscated key.
0.580286626869918 Now, however, a newly identified ransomware, 'CoinVault,' is changing up these tactics by offering victims a "free decrypt," possibly to show good faith on the attackers' side, according to a SecureList blog post .
0.558855847257479 The Smart Protection Network\u2122 protects users against CoinVault and CRYPAURA malware by blocking all files and malicious URLs related to this threat.
0.1638241008624372 These include instructions and removal tools to get rid of FBIRansomWare and Coinvault ransomware, as well Trend Micro's ransomware removal tool and instructions on how to use it.
0.251956075701323 This freemium model was seen in the malware CoinVault , but this CTB Locker variant upped the ante by allowing the victim to choose five files, rather than just one, to be decrypted.
0.3240012030915021 A new breed of ransomware called TorrentLocker that mimics more feared versions like CryptoLocker and CryptoWall has been discovered targeting users in Australia.
0.55765508732601 As far as i know, Teerac.A (Microsoft's name) aka Torrent Locker was using a "CryptoLocker" identity :
0.473038235318943 CryptoLocker copycat, TorrentLocker, discovered by researchers.
0.407065606609179 It's called Crypt0L0cker - the letter "o" has been replaced by zeroes - and, despite the name, the malware has much more in common with TorrentLocker that CryptoLocker .
0.3422409995119455 Security experts from iSIGHT Partners have detected a new piece of PC ransomware they dubbed TorrentLocker, and say that it is an entirely new strain that imitates both CryptoLocker and CryptoWall .
0.1603088777336776 "TorrentLocker is a new strain of ransom malware that appears to use components of CryptoLocker and CryptoWall, but the code is completely different from the other two ransomware families.
0.542838470407501 TorrentLocker is nowhere near as widespread a threat as CryptoLocker or CryptoWall, and researchers don't expect that to change much.
0.601039129954252 TorrentLocker is similar to an earlier ransomware family ( CryptoLocker ), and also encrypts various files and forces users to pay a sum of money.

0.3398503633844166 Variants such as CryptoLocker and CryptoWall have been siphoning money from victims for some time, and now researchers have dissected a newer variant known as TorrentLocker and found that the creators made a key mistake that enables them to recover encrypted files in some circumstances.
0.512484434415535 Cybercriminals have pocketed substantial payments from victims infected by TeslaCrypt , a relatively new ransomware threat known for being distributed through the Angler Exploit Kit (EK).
0.662776178145462 Despite the snappy name, the similarity between the original CryptoLocker and TeslaCrypt is negligible (approximately 8%), researchers explained: "So it would seem the attackers are just re-using the brand.".
0.252939671675849 In the first quarter of 2015, McAfee Labs registered a 165% increase in new ransomware driven largely by the new, hard-to-detect CTB-Locker ransomware family, new ransomware families such as Teslacrypt and TOX , and the emergence of new versions of CryptoWall, TorrentLocker, and BandarChor.
0.2418856663803419 TeslaCrypt is a CryptoLocker variant that specifically targets gamers , but that scope could be soon expanding with some researchers noting that exploit kits including Nuclear, Sweet Orange and Angler, have been dropping TeslaCrypt.
0.207871358997550 TeslaCrypt was discovered at the end of February, researchers at Bromium that analyzed the malicious code have discovered that it was distributed through a compromised WordPress website set up to redirect visitors to a page hosting the Angler exploit kit .
0.2299288850110157 The Teslacrypt ransom note (top) is similar to CryptoLocker's (bottom).
0.560563709365489 Crowti is also using digitally signed malware.
0.521545156642727 Cryptowall (Crowti) usually ends up on a victim's machine in one of these three ways: This latest malware delivery campaign makes use of previously installed malware and exploit kits to download the ransomware and run it.
0.735547969014596 Like CryptoWall and its variants, Crowti eventually directs its victims to a Tor page and gives them instructions on how to purchase Bitcoin to unlock their information.
0.795363789238720 Microsoft stumbled upon a sample of Crowti
0.3949653254078281 Researchers have also seen Crowti propagating via popular exploit kits like Nuclear , RIG and RedKit V2, exploiting old and out-of-date versions of Adobe Flash and Oracle Java.
0.4315703993236077 The infamous Crowti ransomware often dubbed Cryptowall is back with a new campaign, this time using the I2P anonymity network to communicate with its command and control infrastructure.
0.2627817278555417 The Microsoft Malware Protection Center's Marianne Mallen said Redmond had seen a sudden spike from no infections on 11 January to 288 the following day, after an almost two month hiatus for Crowti.
0.763728859210856 While Crowti shares several traits with other types of ransomware, it's even borrowing their names as well.
0.707523022940809 The Point-of-Sale malware, dubbed " PoSeidon ", is designed in a way that it has the capabilities of both the infamous Zeus banking Trojan and BlackPOS malware which robbed Millions from US giant retailers, Target in 2013 and Home Depot in 2014.
0.795110922320894 Backoff is just another piece of point-of-sale (POS) malware, explained Jaime Blasco, labs director of security startup AlienVault.
0.1508863265214813 In a press release detailing the investigation's findings, Dairy Queen included a list of the locations hit as well as the time periods that Backoff was present on their systems, which varied by location.
0.1744121121336412 International Dairy Queen Inc. has confirmed that systems in nearly 400 of its stores had been infected with Backoff, a malware that the company said is targeting retailers across the country.
0.779933085276812 The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US-CERT ), in collaboration with Trustwave SpiderLabs , FS-ISAC and the U.S. Secret Service , recently issued an alert warning of new malware called Backoff, which specifically targets point-of-sale (PoS) systems.
0.3822093732401219 We have been seeing attacks like this one on PoS systems over the past few years, said Jaime Blasco, labs director of security startup AlienVault, in a comment to Infosecurity. Again in this case, the attackers brute-forced remote access tools, including Remote Desktop and LogMeIn, and when they gained access, they deployed the malware. Like others, Backoff scraps the memory to extract track data (i.e. credit card information). Once hackers obtain that data, they filter that information to a remote server where they can then sell it on the black market.
0.654290257794511 3.1 Protection Layer The analyzed sample of Backoff is wrapped with a runtime packer to protect it from detection and analysis.
0.520062308123174 3.6 Command And Control Unlike the previously documented POS malware families Backoff is not based on a local infrastructure, but directly communicates to a C&C server on the internet.
0.2239771935652862 A few months have passed since the release of the "Backoff" point-of-sale (PoS) malware advisory , but Backoff and other PoS malware continue to be an active threat as businesses keep reporting data breaches and the compromise of their customers' financial information.
0.73605595959713 A new and more fine-tuned version of the Backoff point of sale malware known as ROM has been spotted in the wild, according to researchers.
0.150181166747592 A new breed of point-of-sale malware has been found in several recent attacks, and experts say that the tool, known as Backoff, has extensive data stealing and exfiltration capabilities, including keylogging, memory scraping and injection into running processes.
0.0747402149757163 A similar advisory was issued by the FBI at the beginning of this year against other RAM-scraping malware variants, but despite those warnings, new research now shows that attackers are continuing to utilize Backoff to a devastating effect.
0.1063300440717446 A U.S. Department of Homeland Security July 31 advisory warned that more than 1,000 businesses had been hit by Backoff.
0.151706465053899 According to Fortinet's Chan, the latest variant of Backoff, dubbed "ROM" (and detected as W32/Backoff.B!
0.0832221826978580 According to the report, Backoff infections grew 57 percent from August to September and 27 percent during the month of September.
0.3974107359757832 According to the US-CERT advisory, the group behind the Backoff malware operation scanned the Internet to find potential victims by detecting installations of the remote-desktop software frequently used by service providers to manage the point-of-sale systems of their retail clients.
0.4834303676488720 Also, unlike previous Backoff versions, ROM doesn't disguise itself as a Java component, but instead, a media player under the name mplaterc.exe.
0.4008069997511981 Among the latest news items, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council issued a bulletin advising retailers to review security controls to ensure protection against Backoff malware , and Krebs on Security reported a possible Dairy Queen breach at a number of stores in several states.

0.551513314167454 "Backoff shows that businesses haven't learned the lesson yet," Blasco said. "The lessons to learn from the latest retailer breaches are: don't expose critical systems such as PoS devices to the Internet, especially if you are running Remote Desktop or similar. If for some reason you have to do it, try to create access lists so that only certain IP addresses can access those devices and use strong passwords or even two-factor authentication.

0.739675464761533 How can companies protect against Backoff malware?
0.4274176809287446 If that's true, it wouldn't come as a huge surprise, given that some noted security experts believe the Backoff victim count will far exceed the initial estimate of 1000, and could even climb over 10,000 when the dust finally settles.
0.1787242312121143 In a press release detailing the investigation's findings, Dairy Queen included a list of the locations hit as well as the time periods that Backoff was present on their systems, which varied by location.

0.3142169372350830 On Monday, Karl Sigler, threat intelligence manager at Trustwave told SCMagazine.com that Backoff has grown to encompass variants similar to " LAST ," or version 1.56, the latest version of the threat.
0.2470350119334466 Point-of-sale (POS) malware rocketed in the third quarter, with Backoff infections spiking over 50% from August to September, as big name retailers were caught out time and again, according to Damballa.
0.053153974398446 Point-of-sale systems have been a juicy target for hackers; the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report repeatedly has warned small businesses to be vigilant about these types of attacks, and experts have warned about malware families such as Backoff and others that are essentially RAM scrapers, accessing sensitive data in memory.
0.635365158765367 RAM scraping point-of-sale malware has already been the subject of several U.S. government warnings to businesses this year, and the Backoff malware was speculated to have infected more than 1,000 businesses.
0.0949444386373604 Recently the chain of restaurants Dairy Queen announced in an official statement that Backoff infected POS systems at nearly 400 of its stores, but the diffusion of the malicious agent is significant as explained by the Experts at Kaspersky Lab the estimated that more than 1,000 infections were locates in the US.
0.4803410029987673 Report: Backoff malware infections spiked in recent months.

0.739674242676762 Retail security is under the microscope this week, thanks to data breaches at United Parcel Service franchises (and possibly Dairy Queen franchises ), government warnings about the Backoff point-of-sale malware, and new research that shows persistent vulnerabilities in retail applications.
0.5465678389341 ROM performs very similarly to Backoff's previous versions, but modifications have been made to make analysis more difficult and to avoid detection.
0.1393826126747342 Secret Service estimates that 1,000 businesses have been affected by Backoff
0.54890991180672 Security experts at Damballa security firm detected a 57% increase in infections of the popular Backoff malware in the third quarter, the number of infections was jumped high from August to September and in this last month Backoff infections increased 27%.
0.769643079000387 Similarly, Dairy Queen has been hit with Backoff, which has been used in more than one instance , thus proving that nothing is holy to cybercriminals, not even the home of the beloved blizzard.
0.1145725032873564 Since keylogging is an "essential feature" of Backoff, however, researchers believe the malware author may "reintroduce" the capability in a later variant, he said.
0.285383040433594 So, in theory, Apple Pay users would not have been compromised by the Backoff malware.".
0.0998239910730899 So much so that in the last month the US government issued an advisory about the threat posed by the Backoff PoS malware.
0.3516378476313163 Speculation has it that the custom malware used in the breach could have been a variant of the Backoff point-of-sale malware .
0.654503350959097 Such techniques are a common threat to small retail businesses, according to Trustwave, who helped the government agencies in their analysis of and response to the 'Backoff' program.

0.05529670982878720 The APT security firm's Q3 State of Infections report found that Backoff infections grew by 57% during August and another 27% during September.
0.1445250969917558 The Backoff campaign illustrates two key characteristics of today's cyber threat landscape: 1) bad actors are ruthlessly pragmatic, and will continue exploiting vulnerabilities until they're sealed shut; 2) many enterprises are already infected with malware - and yet have no idea - because their traditional security system hasn't sounded any alarm bells.
0.313279397634054 The Backoff malware has been one of the most pervasive strands of point-of-sale malware in recent times and the subject of multiple U.S. government advisories.
0.680432030746944 The major antivirus software vendors have already issued signatures for Backoff and its variants.
0.553824969984695 The malware's spread prompted a summer alert from the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) followed by an urgent request in August by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) for merchants to contact their AV provider to ensure their software detects Backoff.
0.0988483814231868 The new advisory said that seven PoS system vendors confirmed that multiple clients have been affected by Backoff, with the U.S. Secret Service estimating that over 1,000 businesses may ultimately be infected based on the agency's ongoing investigations.
0.1335388581951215 The PCI Security Standards Council has issued a bulletin offering insights for mitigating the Backoff POS malware threat (see: 1,000 Businesses Hit by POS Malware ).
0.209745231604807 The point-of-sale malware, known as 'Backoff', was the subject of another report released by DHS less than a month ago, though at the time, the campaign was only linked to three unnamed breach investigations since it was discovered in October 2013.
0.1433771495699425 The recent Secret Service bulletin doesn't name any of the impacted businesses, but does say that seven PoS system providers have confirmed that they have had "multiple clients" infected with the Backoff malware:
0.73016874986279 The revised damage projection is based on an analysis of intercepted traffic between infected systems and two Backoff command and control servers (C&Cs).
0.316492045316073 The rise of Backoff malware comes in the midst of several high-profile security breaches that affected national retailers like Home Depot , Target and others.
0.37437892159800 The Secret Service recently issued an advisory warning of Backoff, and reported that more than 1,000 businesses had likely been compromised.
0.4546224583174347 The situation is very worrying, law enforcement fears an explosion of the number of infections worldwide, the US Secret Service estimated that as many as 1,000 US businesses may be compromised by Backoff malware.
0.553471608827454 The success of Backoff paints a very bleak picture of the state of point-of-sale security.
0.2129022416449244 The third malware family of interest, Backoff, appears to have been widely used in a more general attack approach.
0.597493786706511 The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued a statement saying that the "Backoff" malware was rife in U.S. businesses, taking over administrator accounts and removing customer data from several hundreds of companies.
0.2460852648121246 The US Secret Service and the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team warned in July and August that more than 1,000 retail companies had been breached by a malicious program known as Backoff.
0.628089915374115 The variant LAST was noted as injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe, so that Backoff could maintain persistence on affected devices if the executable crashes or is "forcefully stopped," Trustwave revealed in an overview of the malware .
0.1728120600389302 There is currently a lot of buzz about the Backoff point-of-sale Trojan that is designed to steal credit card information from computers that have POS terminals attached.
0.266649368032424 This blog has briefly outlined the installation and unique attributes of the latest version of the Backoff PoS malware.
0.4346488656481388 This means of persistence is performed by a piece of code which Backoff injects to explorer.exe.
0.581717073002333 This version also does not have a version number, but has been given the name Backoff ROM.
0.1149061901793849 This will terminate the original Backoff process and delete the initial copy of itself.
0.665907350287227 Though Dairy Queen has not clarified how the malware infiltrated its payment systems, the advisory noted at the time that the attackers spreading Backoff targeted the user credentials of employees that worked remotely, using remote desktop applications like Splashtop to install the malware on corporate systems.
0.4535540460359057 Threat expert demos the 'Backoff' POS malware.
0.3715331438536142 To date, DHS said that seven POS vendors had confirmed that they "had multiple clients affected" by Backoff.
0.3234215686243816 To date, federal investigators estimate more than 1,000 U.S. businesses have been compromised by Backoff, which typically infects POS systems through the exploit of credentials used to access remote-access management software.
0.261832476630387 To get an idea on the breadth and scale of this issue in the Retail sector, the Department of Homeland Security's US-CERT sent out an alert on July 31 st wide spread prevalence of one single malware variant used in POS machines - BackOff.
0.213915110503924 Trend Micro detects Backoff variants as TSPY_POSLOGR.A , TSPY_POSLOGR.B , and TSPY_POSLOGR.C .
0.599173041518818 Uncovered in late July, Backoff scrapes memory from running processes on targeted devices, and has therefore been planted on retailers' POS systems by criminals desiring to pilfer consumer card data.
0.1871084893794904 "Uninstall" a. Removes all files associated with Backoff.
0.1259183118214841 Up until now, the BackOff family was thought to be among the most prolific and sophisticated - hitting big name brands including Dairy Queen and UPS.
0.1160591983601807 UPS, however, has not yet confirmed that the malware used in the attack, which affected 51 of its stores, was, in fact, Backoff.
0.572483267544344 UPS says it began auditing all POS systems at UPS Stores for malware infections after receiving a July 31 government alert about a rise in POS malware attacks , including a number of Backoff variants designed to infect POS systems and steal credit and debit card data when cards are swiped.
0.774212340235322 UPS says it initiated an investigation into possible POS network intrusions after federal authorities issued an alert about emerging malware, including the new memory-scraping POS malware known as Backoff , which has been identified in a handful of recent forensics investigations tied to retail breaches.
0.767351677388481 U.S. businesses have had their systems infected by Backoff
0.739787981227715 U.S. Department of Homeland Security July 31 advisory warned that more than 1,000 businesses had been hit by Backoff
0.0648724004905949 US-CERT encourages administrators and operators of Point-of-Sale systems to review the Backoff malware alert to help determine if your network may be affected.
0.4832277707495219 US-CERT found that Backoff in general has four capabilities: Scraping memory for track data; logging keystrokes; command & control (C2) communication; and injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe, which is responsible for persistence in the event the malicious executable crashes or is forcefully stopped.
0.645890770736392 US-CERT is warning of a fresh malware dubbed Backoff
0.593747610823854 We ran BackOff with Invincea's Freespace to understand how BackOff behaves on an infected system.
0.605143178348164 What is concerning form the table is the fact that there are only 8/8 submissions of BACKOFF in the last two months in VirusTotal, while we have been seeing a significant increase in breach reporting (see Figure 23).
0.345087744948708 While some security researchers predicted that Backoff was the likely culprit in the Home Depot breach, unnamed investigators reportedly named a different malicious program, BlackPOS, as the attack tool.
0.51048130756854 Zaichkowsky pointed to Backoff, or a similar memory-scraping point-of-sale infector, as a likely culprit as well.
0.523132309979867 The malware has been named 'DarkSeoul' and 'Jokra' by the community.
0.0729829096467916 And like DarkSeoul, the Destover wiper executables were compiled somewhere between 48 hours prior to the attack and the actual day of attack.
0.600767684543160 Destover used an internal webserver in the malware to display the message on the screen of affected PCs, just as DarkSeoul did, and the color schemes and themes of the messages displayed in both cases were the same.
0.450254332252117 Destover was detected several times in the last years, one of the most clamorous attacks is DarkSeoul run by Whois team that in 2013 targeted media and banking of the the South Korea, and the television networks YTN, MBC and KBS and Shinhan Bank and NongHyup Bank, two major banks of the country, suffered serious outage.
0.0754663131999119 It also revealed that the tools used in the Sony attack had similarities to those used in the DarkSeoul attacks against South Korean banks and media companies in 2013.
0.523479519726735 The "DarkSeoul" attack was never previously publicly attributed directly to North Korea by security professionals, though it was widely assumed that its Unit 121 hacking team was connected in some way.
0.669894592378263 The DarkSeoul attacks, examined in the Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report and a big focus for our researchers last year, are an example of this strategy.
0.577211498335683 The executables for both Destover and DarkSeoul were compiled between 24 and 48 hours before the attacks, Baumgartner said, making it likely that attackers had already gained access to their targets' networks.
0.4582620452799114 The newly identified DarkSeoul group is also responsible for a new wave of attacks that hit South Korea on Tuesday and were timed to coincide with the 63rd anniversary of the state of the Korean War.
0.0956971366922082 Thoughts on DarkSeoul: data sharing and targeted Attackers.
0.711975750848348 Breaking it down simply, Oppenheim explained that the BLACKCOFFEE malware is programmed to reach out to a Microsoft TechNet page - attacker-created profile pages and forum threads, the report indicates - and look for a keyword string, which in this case is an encoded string between the terms "@Microsoft" and "Corporation.".
0.0821957747983784 FireEye has revealed that a China-based hacking group has been using Microsoft TechNet as a relay for C&C addresses for BlackCoffee malware, but experts tell us it's nothing novel.
0.4712475105083241 PCs infected by the group's BLACKCOFFEE malware are instructed to contact this domain and will then be sent on to the real C&C address for further instructions.
0.355397418918078 "The machines are still infected with the BLACKCOFFEE malware and we are hoping that working with Microsoft and other security vendors, along with this blog being released, we can help clean up these other systems.".
0.6808202901916 The strain of BLACKCOFFEE backdoor detected by FireEye contains URLs that point to TechNet forum threads or biography sections in profiles created by the threat actors.
0.2065043901457638 "This way the machines with BLACKCOFFEE were communicating with our sinkhole machine and not communicating with the attacker machines," Oppenheim said.
0.384400197962256 The threat involves BLACKCOFFEE malware, which FireEye has monitored APT17 using since 2013.
0.450325069878479 A lot of malware impacts control systems, like Conficker or Slammer, said Joel Langill, security consultant and author of the SCADAhacker blog, referring to two computer worms that caused headaches for tens of thousands of people using Microsoft.
0.053359365027870 The next two years would see the Slammer and Blaster worms, even more damaging than the worms of 2001.
0.50501176311298 Unfortunately, he said, many in the transportation industry have forgotten the impact of the Slammer and Blaster worms around eight years ago. I am afraid we have seen that any industry can be a victim of attack, but the most likely sectors to be targeted include transportation, energy, finance, telecoms and military, he said.
0.23899775587798 A demo of an exploit for the hole at the Black Hat Briefings in the Summer of 2003 also raised the profile of the SQL vulnerability, but to no avail: few SQL Server users had applied the company's patch by the time January rolled around (Litchfield estimated fewer than 1 in 10 had been patched prior to the release of Slammer).
0.237998563881827 For Microsoft in 2003, Slammer was a reminder that the company still had a long way to go if it wanted to see its nascent Trustworthy Computing effort bear fruit.
0.562512663567132 If you sent precisely 1.0 billion SQL Slammer packets, you'll see the 1.0 billion count appear on the console - even though the precise number of events in the database will be considerably less.
0.559789819980318 Or the SQL Slammer worm that attacked Windows 2000 systems?
0.710808467135912 Slammer was the first of many such vulnerabilities, and it was the catalyst that pushed vendors to start offering regular security patches.
0.449201368542772 SQL Slammer was based on proof of concept code privately disclosed to the company by UK security researcher David Litchfield months before, and quickly patched by the company.
0.1560524143716832 SQL Slammer worm in 2003, leading to potential Distributed Denial of Service attacks
0.339784560947245 That sort of penetration was probably exceeded by various network worms of the early 2000s, such as CodeRed , Nimda and Slammer ; in the last few years, however, viruses of that replicative power just haven't been seen.
0.4711832605953081 These IRC Bots started to emerge as the next generation of malware after nifty worm breakouts like Blaster, Sasser and Slammer.

0.2835962803031476 Gh0st RAT was already in circulation among other hackers before it was modified for use by the Hainan-based attack.
0.651944801867594 Given that the C&C infrastructure for the attack is located in the Hong Kong area, the use of Gh0st RAT, the use of a particular script kit for victim redirection, and the targets of interest, the researchers believe that the attack was likely orchestrated and carried out by the same threat actors that effected the Aurora and Ghostnet attack campaigns.
0.630992061687867 If the exploits were successful, it would install the Gh0st RAT on the targeted computer in order for the attackers to have control over it.

0.2630443125680661 We always try to figure out, not just how a piece of malicious code works, but also other possibilities, like whether it is related to some other malware, in what way, etc. Gh0st has been much talked about and there is a lot of good research out there on this RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
0.605597116849310 We saw the same technique employed by two notorious remote access tools (RAT): Gh0st RAT and IXESHE .
0.427886755031936 While Gh0st RAT has been used in many targeted attacks, this threat and its many variants , are widely available to both APT actors and cybercriminals alike.
0.500145286212677 While the significance of this malware was not fully understood until the entire cyber-espionage network was exposed, it is Deep Discovery can detect the specific understandable that creating intrusion detection system "Gh0st" and "LURK0" headers as well as (IDS) rules based on such paths was probably not a high generically detect this kind of communication priority for defenders at that time.
0.4846376168326821 While ransomware variants such as CryptoLocker, CryptoWall and TorrentLocker are primarily focused on encrypting files for extortion, the Hesperbot RAT primarily targets internet banking end users (including many well-known Australian banks and credit unions).
0.0845074680513100 "Organizations should educate their employees to follow best security practices, such as only using POS systems for what they are intended for and not to browse the web, check email, play video games, etc.," researchers from security firm Trustwave wrote last month in a blog post that advised organizations on how to protect their systems against a memory-scraping memory program called Punkey.
0.4499868091969305 Punkey, with an investigation by the U.S. Secret Service identifying evidence of compromised payment card information as well as more than 75 infected - and active - IP addresses linked to point-of-sale terminals running Windows systems
0.679704722739887 Regarding Punkey's impact, Sigler said that the joint investigation with law enforcement revealed that 75 unique POS terminals may be infected with the malware.
0.169641250434500 Security researchers from Trustwave now warn that during a recent investigation with the U.S. Secret Service, they've uncovered yet another RAM-scraping PoS threat they've named Punkey.
0.101874392006414 Standout qualities of the Punkey POS family were its use of AES encryption with an embedded key, and a "rare feature" that gives it the ability to download additional malware on targeted systems, which could further criminals' reconnaissance efforts or allow them to perform privilege escalation, Merritt wrote.
0.4635967675053549 "This gives Punkey the ability to run additional tools on the system such as executing additional reconnaissance tools or performing privilege escalation," the Trustwave researchers said in a blog post .
0.3688618204768414 This malware component is related to the Punkey point-of-sale (PoS) malware, which was uncovered in April 2015.
0.645012007087374 "This was the only definitive number we have, but it does not mean that Punkey was limited to these 75 infections.".
0.396562264376802 Trustwave's Merritt also wrote a decryption tool in Ruby (available on Github ) and created a Yara signature that detects all versions of Punkey that the firm observed.
0.3748092150276053 What's especially worrying about Punkey, notes Computer World , is that the program is able to download and execute other malicious files, including updates for itself.
0.2745661365918825 "While the two families of malware share some tactics, Punkey goes to greater lengths to hide in the system," Mador explained.
0.3279167387791077 Andr/SlfMite-A is trying to take the sort of same advantage, relying on the mutual trust that often exists between Android-using contacts.
0.611754804984627 Another new trick up SlfMite-B's sleeve is to copy the self-protection behaviour of the FBILock-A malware we wrote about in July, after SlfMite-A came out.

0.373452217306000 Here are my tips to avoid having your computer infected with Cryptowall, or any other ransomware:
0.635868022738055 However, as of this publication, CryptoWall is thought to be controlled and used by a single threat group.
0.717999252599849 However, with CryptoWall 3.0, the user's traffic is also passed through another anonymity network called I2P.
0.4190667078606520 If the check indicates that the parent process name is "perl.exe" or "python.exe", then the program runs the following endless loop and never runs the Cryptowall 3.0 code.
0.765050153397006 If the encrypted connection goes well, the communication with the Cryptowall Command & Control server will take places; otherwise the main thread sleeps for a random number of seconds and then retries with a new generated server name.
0.741264338516359 If you're "had", Cryptowall encrypts all the files that you possible could want to keep (images, documents, etc), and then asks for a 500$ ransom.
0.2480553286077761 In a blog post this week, researchers Andrea Allievi and Earl Carter of Cisco's Talos Group presented a full code dissection of CryptoWall 2.0 and found a few surprises, aside from using a number of different, sophisticated features to attack systems and evade detection before it can strike.
0.775693177695661 In a first time, the VirusTotal detection rate for this variant of CryptoWall ransomware was zero, afterwards it was improved with further analysis and in time I'm writing it is still low, just 24 on51, which makes this threat very insidious.

0.3261619980234815 The second stage dropper creates a uniquely named version of the main CryptoWall installation code based on an MD5 hash of the computer's name and installs auto-run registry entries for the executable so that it will restart, including one that ensures that it will start even if the computer is rebooted in "safe mode.".
0.244026386228076 The threat actors behind the campaign exploited a Drive-by downloads tactic to deliver the CryptoWall ransomware , the experts discovered that the attack was delivered via the Zedo ad network and originated from the following five Alexa top-ranked domains:
0.175512868598090 The town manager of a hamlet in south eastern New Hampshire has defied demands that he pay a ransom to recover police department computer files taken hostage by Cryptowall, a newer piece of malware that encrypts hard drive contents of infected machines until victims pay for them to be decrypted.
0.148221592615093 The VM checker code, in the first stage of CryptoWall's dropper sequence, checks the system for running processes, searching for VMware and VirtualBox services or the Sandboxie application partitioning library.
0.2184785197650732 There is the chance that data will be lost on the PC and on shared network resources, thanks to ransomware like CryptoWall and CryptoLocker .
0.570351114778634 This appears to also have been the case with the recent Cryptowall example.
0.559369576777787 This campaign is a bit different than others, as it involves two (2) stages of user intervention; the user must execute the initial file attached to the e-mail within a ZIP archive, but then must execute the additional file-a binary file masked as a SCR to appear to be a legitimate Adobe Reader PDF document-which contains the CryptoWall 3.0 payload.
0.695307279004273 This is the Cryptowall ransomware that the Magnitude admin distributes.
0.4792611965869333 This new variant of Cryptowall also implements an anti-VM and anti-emulation checks pass that prevents the execution in a virtualized environment for malware analysis.
0.462964035952409 Threats like CryptoLocker and CryptoWall hold your data hostage, encrypting them and demanding a ransom be paid for their safe return.
0.417090065798624 Through June 13, this sinkhole received connections from 968 unique hosts that appeared to be infected with early CryptoWall variants (see Figure 4).
0.564545765818527 To unpack fully, Cryptowall runs explorer.exe process, then svchost.exe, which is hollowed out and resumed.
0.657564067545867 Typically, CryptoWall encrypts the victims' files with a strong RSA 2048 encryption algorithm until the victim pays a ransom fee to get them decrypted.
0.1781436665892429 Unfortunately for users, Cryptowall 3.0 is as destructive as previous variants: it encrypts files found on the infected machines, and asks the victims to pay up in order to get the decryption key.
0.70929574734885 Unlike the crooks SophosLabs found who are trying to copy CryptoLocker but without actually encrypting your files, Cryptowall's encryption can't be reversed without the key.

0.379724803336528 We found that the malware also drops and also spreads CryptoWall and online banking malware.
0.512377824836305 What makes CryptoWall so dangerous is that its malware is able to encrypt files stored not only on local hard drives, but on mapped network shared drives, including cloud storage services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.
0.0925744760652756 When CryptoWall is first executed, it unpacks itself in memory and injects malicious code into new processes that it creates.
0.413378670145181 When executed this file is dropping Cryptowall on the system and compromising it.

0.288831838468669 Miniduke Attacks are Back in Force, Says Kaspersky Lab.
0.587114661680190 The CosmicDuke malware involved in the campaign hit the headlines in July when it surfaced as a 'mongrel' hybrid of the MiniDuke malware family.
0.2132150400864921 The Miniduke advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign that has been dormant for more than a year is.
0.2300103433737237 A complex variant of the MiniDuke malware - first seen almost 18 months ago and which targets NATO and other European government IT systems - has been spotted.
0.535754837060669 A year ago Kaspersky Lab uncovered a MiniDuke campaign that appears to be a clear cyber espionage attack against "governments of Ireland, Romania, Portugal, Belgium and the Czech Republic.".
0.1582970673221739 A year back, Security Researchers from the Antivirus firm Kaspersky found a sophisticated piece of malware which they dubbed as 'MiniDuke', designed specifically to collect and steal strategic insights and highly protected political information, which is a subject to states' security.
0.3200304421854538 After investigating further, F-Secure has found that the malware used in this case is related via its infrastructure to the notorious MiniDuke family which has been used in targeted attacks against NATO and European government agencies.
0.4208742343101865 Anyway, the list of Miniduke's targets suggests that people behind it gather a wide scope of political and business data from the attacked parties.
0.52861139688107 As Ars previously reported , MiniDuke combined older and newer styles: it was written in assembly language, which rendered its file size tiny, and it uses hijacked Twitter accounts and automated Google searches to ensure that it can receive continuous instructions.
0.3026112078504369 As of today, the newly discovered MiniDuke sample was still seeking encrypted command and control instructions via an active Twitter account, with a single instruction dated February 21st, 2012.
0.2240450392903916 Attackers behind the MiniDuke spy campaign have targeted government entities and other organizations around the world since at least 2011.
0.0622940874550881 Attackers with a control infrastructure based in China are leveraging the same vulnerability exploited by Miniduke to attack Uyghur and Tibetan activists with new exploits.
0.544298099583106 Based on the analysis, it appears that MiniDuke's creators provide a dynamic backup system that also can fly under the radar.
0.599423392261506 Blocking "MiniDuke" Type Threats Using Exploit Interception.
0.788732546539032 CosmicDuke : In April 2014, experts at F-Secure, while investigating on MiniDuke malicious code discovered a link to a new strain of malware, dubbed CosmicDuke, belonging to Cosmu family.
0.718436215603535 CVE-2013-0640) that was made infamous by the " MiniDuke " campaign
0.292582967968065 Early 2013 experts at Kaspersky Lab and Hungary's Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) uncovered a cyber espionage campaign dubbed Miniduke which targeted dozens of computers at government agencies across Europe in.
0.05583186274940965 Evidence of an older MiniDuke iteration was included in Bitdefender's blog.
0.4185745317683152 Fascinating MiniDuke backdoor hits again.
0.3968868852163709 First and foremost is Miniduke's infection vector.
0.0607484582928440 From one of the old style Miniduke servers we were able to extract a list of victims and their corresponding countries.
0.433671055660107 However, on further analysis in April this year, Hirvonen and his team discovered that the Cosmu malware family used the same loader as MiniDuke.
0.1513731075772144 In fact, it went all the way back to the notorious Russian APT family MiniDuke, known to have been used in targeted attacks against NATO and European government agencies.
0.630580497608615 In February 2014 we observed the Miniduke threat actor using the same backdoor on their hacked servers, although using a much stronger password.
0.540803642452110 In reality MiniDuke activities were reported for first time a couple of weeks ago by FireEye security firm that noted a malicious agent able to infecting machines by circulating compromised PDFs.
0.635721413336826 In the wake of our publications from 2013, the Miniduke campaigns have stopped or at least decreased in intensity.
0.069500418726611 In this case, "666" is specified as the preferred image base address whereas in MiniDuke's case, it is referenced as stray bytes in its code.
0.1143550998776319 Initially CosmicDuke was initially linked to MiniDuke because the researchers discovered that the two malicious code was using the same loader, the new discovery confirms the suspect.
0.392833887409131 Kaspersky and CrySys Lab found that the underground network wielding MiniDuke
0.1595642745576574 Kaspersky Lab researchers have discovered that the old style Miniduke implants from 2013 are still around.
0.577672036733834 Kaspersky Lab's team of experts published a new research report that analyzed a series of security incidents involving the use of the recently discovered PDF exploit in Adobe Reader (CVE-2013-6040) and a new, highly customized malicious program known as MiniDuke.
0.05974186259794611 Kaspersky Lab's team of experts recently published a new research report that analyzed that Cyber criminals have targeted government officials in more than 20 countries, including Ireland and Romania with a new piece of malware called ' MiniDuke '.
0.741259501186162 Last week, Kaspersky Lab and the cryptography research lab at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (called CrySys Lab) revealed the first details about MiniDuke, customized malware that takes advantage of a now-patched Adobe Reader vulnerability (CVE-2013-6040), affecting versions 9 through 11 of the software.

0.0638879925887112 MiniDuke, as researchers from Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab
0.398862816036927 MiniDuke, as researchers from Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab have dubbed the threat, bears the hallmark of viruses first encountered in the mid 1990s, when shadowy groups such as 29A engineered innovative pieces of malware for fun and then documented them in an E-Zine by the same name.
0.2358537254907607 MiniDuke espionage ring began earlier than first reports suggest.
0.4349043778463531 MiniDuke hackers target European governments and researchers.
0.2480131683909152 MiniDuke has taken hold of government agencies, think tanks, a US-based
0.15665516761149 Miniduke is rather unique among other APT campaigns; at the time of its initial discovery it used a custom backdoor, written in the "relatively outdated" Assembler programming language; had a peculiar C&C infrastructure with multiple redundancy paths including Twitter accounts, and a form of steganography in which the developers stealthily transferred their updated executables in .gif files.
0.537800425300176 MiniDuke malware is written in assembly language with its tiny file size (20KB), and uses hijacked Twitter accounts for Command & Control and incase twitter accounts are not active, the malware located backup control channels via Google searches.
0.2803325222368465 MiniDuke - the cyberspy malware aimed at governments and agencies in Europe
0.4185677927178389 MiniDuke - the extremely small and highly customized Asembler-based backdoor used in the past to target mostly government entities and institutions around the world - has been spotted again, this time...
0.385776851408667 MiniDuke's highly customized backdoor was written in Assembler and is very small in size, being only 20kb," added Kaspersky.
0.566239759036178 New Miniduke adds a handful of "fox tail" feature to throw off researchers.
0.50728167651785 New Web-Based MiniDuke Components Discovered.
0.331931034052591 Now, once again the MiniDuke virus is spreading in wild via an innocent looking but fake PDF documents.
0.538116216745086 On Saturday, Romanian anti-virus firm Bitdefender revealed in a blog post that an older sample of MiniDuke has turned up, leading the firm to posit that the malware has been in use since as early as June 2011.
0.2111823648546390 Our research indicates that attackers engaged in APT campaigns may have adapted the exploit made infamous by the MiniDuke campaign and have incorporated it into their arsenal.
0.074455788431976 Over a year ago, security firm Kaspersky published its findings on a new strain of malware it dubbed "MiniDuke."
0.1867255521076829 Probably yes, but only because these tools require some intellectual effort to be used, as opposed to purely running off of malice, greed, and pathologic cunning (and the knowledge of where to download your next Miniduke-like Trojan).
0.344943994395760 Putting two and two together, it wasn't hard to speculate that MiniDuke was being used for state-sponsored espionage.
0.789320215120393 Quisquater, a professor at the Université catholique de Louvain, told Meyer that his computer was infected approximately six months ago, by a variant of the MiniDuke malware.
0.1004513317669943 Researchers noted some similarities between previous attacks and MiniDuke, an indication the attackers could be borrowing and adapting their respective tactics.
0.461646335750474 Security experts collected further evidences of the link between the CosmicDuke, Miniduke and OnioDuke Advanced Persistent Threat campaigns.
0.4030295301664804 The beginning of 2014 saw the re-activation of MiniDuke, an APT campaign from early 2013.
0.599578837725063 The Carbon backdoors, meanwhile, share characteristics with other attack platforms such as Tilded and Flame, as well as some subtle connections to Miniduke .
0.503011349711804 "The discovery of this older MiniDuke malware strain raises questions about the origin of the 2012 samples and the malware as a whole," said Bitdefender Chief Security Strategist Catalin Cosoi.
0.567821054990543 The main "new" Miniduke backdoor (aka TinyBaron or CosmicDuke) is compiled using a customizable framework called "BotGenStudio", which has flexibility to enable/disable components when the bot is constructed.
0.322764605540006 The malicious Tor exit node located in Russia that added malicious code to the software downloaded by users has been tied to the APT actors wielding the MiniDuke backdoor.
0.053436961298758 The malware family discovered was using the same loader as MiniDuke stage 3 .
0.1066858908192203 The malware in question, known as MiniDuke, had many interesting features: it was tiny in size at 20KB.
0.2099097284910581 "The malware used in this case is, however, not a version of MiniDuke.
0.606663326032870 The Miniduke advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign is back.
0.4864398721449073 The Miniduke APT campaign is back in business with new tools to steal data from new targets in an assortment of countries from all over the globe.
0.250138581939096 The old style Miniduke implants from 2013 are still around and being used during the current campaigns.
0.57515157798017 The victims are various, some research institutes and other entities including an US think tank were attacked by a malware dubbed "MiniDuke".
0.654047707768346 These three items helped us identify the similarities between MiniDuke and Zegost.
0.1936681062257186 This dropped a variant of the MiniDuke malware which covertly opens a backdoor onto the infected computer.
0.796642825310523 This dropper opens its decoy PDF directly using the ShellExecute API whereas MiniDuke's dropper creates a BAT file that kills the existing acrobat process along with opening the decoy PDF.
0.1011861363625651 This has no connection with the MiniDuke malware payload.)
0.300810317581228 To investigate similar cases, we have created a tool for extracting the payloads and the decoy documents from MiniDuke PDF files.
0.309709111428834 What is very interesting is that if MiniDuke is not able to receive Tweets it execute Google searches to receive orders from C&C servers.
0.391111088104849 While investigating on MiniDuke malware, experts at F-Secure discovered a surprising link to a new malware, dubbed CosmicDuke, belonging to Cosmu family.
0.309917348048040 While the old style Miniduke implants were used to target mostly government victims, the new style CosmicDuke implants have a somehow different typology of victims.
0.689261535013511 With Dennis Fisher out of pocket at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Ryan Naraine hijacks the Digital Underground podcast and gets on the phone with Kaspersky Lab research guru Costin Raiu to talk about the intricacies of the miniDuke malware campaign.
0.374925132207027 Yet another large-scale threat was detected in Q2: MiniDuke , an APT campaign from early 2013 reignited, bringing in some serious and novel additions.
0.171642412791891 Tinba uses a DGA based on a hard-coded domain and seed which are unique to each sample generating 1,000 unique domains.
0.697762991337506 "64-bit is a class of computer architecture which basically allows the usage of additional computer resources [such as] memory, [and so on]," Raff said. "However, it also requires the operating system and applications to support this architecture. Tinba now added support to inject itself to such applications."
0.0709324156691856 A few months ago, Tinba's source code was leaked in the wild.
0.343646084340243 An example of an injected form from Tinba Trojan targeting U.S. Bank customers.
0.3760286478768609 " As observed in several other Trojan-bankers and advanced malwares, Tinba utilizes a RC4 encryption algorithm when communication with its Command & Control (C&C) servers.
0.0954911570070657 "Banks that deploy these types of systems are able to effectively detect and block the activity of Tinba, Tilon, Shylock and many other financial malware strains that use this same Man in the Browser (MitB) tactic.".
0.4933022411650581 Both a default list of target URLs and an injection script are encrypted within Tinba's code.
0.0922883860094425 But in order to gather this information efficiently, Tinba must do three things:
0.456939033840526 But Trusteer has discovered that Tinba and Tilon have been recently modified to try out a simpler approach: phishing and blocking users from the actual banking page.

0.655349253955557 For 'Tinba', like many botnets, that information could be browsing data, login credentials, or even banking information, all decided by the botnet master and changed to whatever they desire at any time.
0.4098018185214070 Further, the old-school Tinba targeted only a handful of financial institutions; the new-model malware has broadened its scope to include a larger number of banks globally - including in the United States and Canada.
0.695517984320572 If the first domain does not respond properly, Tinba simply moves on to the next domain down the chain.
0.761416905897079 If the system is vulnerable, then the exploit executes a malicious code which downloads and executes the malware payload, Tinba Trojan.
0.64102431487051 In the attack on the Carnegie Mellon domain, the school's Department of Statistics home page was compromised with malicious Flash code in order to exploit Internet Explorer users and install a banking trojan, called Tinba , on their machines, Segura said.

0.4132505840744029 So while the Tinba trojan has shown some ingenuity in its latest version, the good news is that Seculert customers are already protected from this threat.
0.328993150906086 The cybercriminal group behind the attacks is known as EITest and has distributed an online banking Trojan called Tinba in the past, according to researchers from Malwarebytes.
0.423727578170672 The next keynote was by Peter Kruse of the CSIS Security Group, with the research of Tinba banking malware: a highly sophicticated trojan targeting users mostly in the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
0.0800002302782871 There are three places in which cryptography occurs in Tinba: In both the message header and data for messages sent the bot and the server, and in the default target list used by the bot when it fails to download newer files from the server.
0.731975212382193 This presents the possibility that more than one group could be using the new version of the Tinba trojan.
0.1857090404390583 This version of the "tiny banker" a.k.a. Tinba trojan boasts some pretty potent features, including new detection evasion tactics.
0.403710757284356 threat was named Tinba, or Tinybanker, because of its small size among banking malware, approximately 20 kilobytes, according to researchers at Trend Micro and CSIS Security Group, who wrote the report.
0.496838415459689 Tinba also injects itself into both "explorer.exe" and "svchost.exe" processes.
0.0798201427431229 Tinba got its name from its extraordinarily small size - its code is approximately 20 kilobytes in size, a remarkably small number for banking malware.
0.27901620807451 Tinba has affected more than 60,000 users in Turkey, primarily stealing login details from sites like Facebook, free German webmail service GMX, Google and Microsoft.
0.1006801863926485 Tinba is the latest in a long and distinguished line of banker Trojans that are designed specifically to relieve victims of their money through background monitoring of online banking sessions or modification of Web pages.
0.256139794462690 Tinba now added support to inject itself to such applications.".
0.561768705323133 Tinba particularly targeted banks in Turkey and United Arab Emirates.

0.656832364452660 Unlike the Turkish Incident, where Tinba was being dropped by the Blackhole Exploit Kit, in the current spam, Tinba is directly attached to the email message.
0.1102907001215430 We estimate that there are more than 60,000 users affected by Tinba in Turkey..
0.783247907343986 We observed that for each version of Tinba, this string is a partial match of the domain seed string.
0.2991660571808657 Well, it didn't take long for Seculert's Research Lab to discover Tinba's predecessor, which boasted some even nastier features including: new detection evasion tactics, the ability to 64 bit operating systems, new DGA (domain generating algorithm) capabilities, and the use of both signed and unsigned executables.
0.3326626794182423 When I just checked the file a few minutes ago on VirusTotal, thinking I would see various Zeus-related malware names based on the SCMag / WebSense articles, I was surprised to see that the file was actually TinBa or "Tiny Banker"!
0.764161421003280 When the source code for Tinba - a banker trojan comprised of 20 KB of code - was made public in July 2014, there was speculation among security professionals that a new version of the malware could make an appearance with some new features.

0.2063958638906928 The code to disable it is landing today in Nightly, and will be promoted to Aurora and Beta in the next few weeks.
0.3195640223727962 The school has been linked to the infamous Operation Aurora cyber espionage campaign that hit Google, Adobe, Intel, and many other major US firms more than four years ago, and is located one block from the inventory scanner manufacturer in question, according to TrapX.
0.451086418758249 There are however things similar about Operation Aurora and Night Dragon.
0.735839300656844 This is an arms race, make no mistake, and now with Operation Aurora , the change from the CodeRed days is evident: nation states or at least entities claiming to be nation states are not using their own labs as the primary resort\u2026they are raiding the private sector toolkit for the tools they want and need.

0.314372896184474 Also, Moose affects not just routers, but a host of other devices with embedded Linux systems -- and Moose-infected routers regularly scan for all those other Linux systems.
0.1147537154523313 Although Moose has been specifically targeting consumer Linux routers so far, it's still a concern for enterprises, Bilodeau says.
0.270590086741307 Because of the way that the worm communicates, the ESET researchers were unable to determine the number of devices that have been infected by Moose, which they say they first found late in July of 2014.
0.572341097028818 ESET released a study about a new malware known as Moose worm that is compromising devices that have a weak or default credentials.
0.614710156320432 ESET's team believes that even medical devices, such as the Hospira drug infusion pump, could be infected by the Linux/Moose worm.
0.432840735574264 How to prevent your router from getting infected by Moose worm?
0.354864182713735 I think that malware like the Moose worm can become a serious threat for IoT devices , since all smart objects are always online and connected to peers.
0.2415454381231245 Linux-based Moose worm turns routers into social network bots.
0.1707840084660440 Moose malware uses Linux routers for social network fraud.
0.775058989670885 [Moose worm use the compromised devices to] "steal unencrypted network traffic and offer proxying services to the botnet operator," "In practice, these capabilities are used to steal HTTP Cookies on popular social network sites and perform fraudulent actions such as non-legitimate "follows", "views" and "likes" on such sites."
0.1197065961824551 Perhaps most interesting of all, however, is to try to understand the purpose of the Moose worm.
0.767980375195028 The main purpose of Moose, however, appears to be to create a network of covert HTTP proxies that can be used by the worm's command and control (C&C) servers to communicate with social networks.
0.724032153601423 The malware, which researchers have dubbed Linux/Moose, could be used for a wide variety of purposes -- including DNS hijacking, DDoSing, and deep network penetration -- but so far attackers only seem to be using it for tame social networking fraud.
0.680564326670263 The principal target of the Moose worm are the linux-based routers, in particular, the SOHO devices , including home routers, running on MIPS and ARM architectures.

0.608461650248884 Another Infection: HAVEX Binary Attempts to Appear Digitally Signed.
0.4054918761462815 Based on information ICS-CERT has obtained from Symantec and F-Secure, the software installers for these vendors were infected with malware known as the Havex Trojan.
0.735371578123944 Compared to newer HAVEX versions (>= version 038), this version required another loader as seen below.
0.279327559837541 During the spring of 2014, we noticed that Havex took a specific interest in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and the group behind it uses an innovative trojan horse approach to compromise victims.
0.4829029189358793 Experts at F-Secure recently noticed that Havex was used by attackers to hit Industrial Control Systems (ICS), the criminals have customized the malicious agent infecting software available for download from ICS/SCADA manufacturer websites in an attempt to infect the computers where the software is installed to.
0.502229017906190 Experts question whether the Havex malware campaign targeting three European industrial control system software vendors is merely a dry run for something bigger.
0.748686061512826 FireEye recently analyzed the capabilities of a variant of Havex (referred to by FireEye as "Fertger" or "PEACEPIPE"), the first publicized malware reported to actively scan OPC servers used for controlling SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) devices in critical infrastructure (e.g., water and electric utilities), energy, and manufacturing sectors.
0.79420831394017 From Sep. 2011 to May 2014, through 68 different versions, I do see some improvements, like moving lots of hardcoded values into a single encrypted configuration file, public-key cryptography, information harvester, etc. After we understand the Havex module downloader, we could get all its modules from the server side.
0.1283668911270371 F-Secure and Symantec recently had spotted the attackers targeting mainly energy and some manufacturing firms with the so-called Havex Trojan, and Symantec as far back as March saw the group shifting its focus onto energy firms, with half of the targets in energy and 30% in energy control systems.
0.269008311563957 F-Secure discovered instances of the Havex malware

0.575343955474855 Havex victims are primarily using Windows XP, and a smaller number are using Windows 7, according to the post.
0.1478309692634318 However, over the past few months F-Secure analyzed 88 Havex variants, 146 C&C servers and 1500 related IP addresses in an investigation which revealed a narrowing of focus by the group to Industrial Control Systems (ICS).
0.584134654732056 ICS operators have to take note that the structure of the HAVEX binaries resemble much of what we see in common Windows malware - more so now that we've seen Windows 7 64-bit infections.
0.616951318852698 ICS-CERT has posted a TLP Amber report to its secure portal related to our analysis of ICS/SCADA-focused Havex components .
0.520807312087269 In addition to the usual phishing messages and exploit kits, the attackers compromised the websites of three industrial application vendors and swapped their legitimate installers with ones that would also install HAVEX when downloaded and run.
0.620517117739501 In June 2014 experts at F-Secure discovered instances of the Havex malware used to target Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in surgical attacks implementing " watering-hole attack" scheme which involved ICS vendor site as intermediary target.
0.3498053932912076 In the case of HAVEX, the energy industry, and specifically power plants based in Europe, seems to be the primary target.
0.792259238978206 It is important to note that ICS-CERT testing has determined that the Havex payload has caused multiple common OPC platforms to intermittently crash.
0.05578937395934635 It is possible that the HAVEX RAT is itself a newer version of the SYSMain RAT, although both tools are still in use concurrently and have been operated by the attackers since at least 2011.
0.404100142514361 Meanwhile, F-Secure has claimed that the attackers (who are sometimes also known as "Energetic Bear") used a remote access trojan (RAT) named Havex to hunt for vulnerable industrial control systems (ICS) with a view to ultimately accessing critical infrastructure used to manage electrical, water, oil, gas and data supplies.
0.1562496877437704 One of the primary tools leveraged in Operation Dragonfly is Havex.
0.1763253579077995 Our analysis of Havex sample codes also uncovered its "ICS/SCADA sniffing" behavior.
0.2084587637087553 Over the last week, F-Secure Labs has taken a look at attacks from the "Energetic Bear" hacking group , Havex, which targets the energy sector , and now CosmicDuke, which is aimed at targets in Ukraine, Poland, Turkey, and Russia.
0.574997467290397 Specifically, this Havex variant targets servers involved in OPC (Object linking and embedding for Process Control) communication, a client/server technology widely used in process control systems (for example, to control water pumps, turbines, tanks, etc.).
0.0777421216479906 Symantec researchers have confirmed the findings of their colleagues at F-Secure, who have been monitoring the spreading of the Havex malware family, and have put them in a larger context, tying them ...
0.673305542490694 Symantec's report on the "Dragonfly" group brings additional insight on attackers spreading Havex malware.
0.1114149853924576 The authors of HAVEX certainly understand that OT environments are connected, since the method of transmission is via a downloadable Trojan installed on the websites of several ICS/SCADA manufacturers.
0.4279013490298495 The bad actors behind the Havex campaign mainly targeted companies in the energy industry with the intent to conduct industrial espionage against several American and European companies.
0.4875871719304334 The Havex RAT gathers information about the infected computers and the networks they are connected to and sends it to servers under the control of the attackers.
0.3801301520986679 The Havex RAT is distributed at least through the following channels:
0.2869881357793957 The method by which the Havex RAT targeted industrial control systems owners was clever.
0.2021138377837683 The remote access tool (RAT) HAVEX became the focus of the security industry after it was discovered to have played a major role in a campaign targeting industrial control systems (ICS ).
0.773111278968923 The scanning process starts when the Havex downloader calls the runDll export function.
0.34252384632914 These only infect Windows systems and may include Havex (the most often detected one), Sysmain Trojans, also the ClientX backdoor, Karagany backdoor and related stealers, etc.
0.0618255651419430 Unlike Oldrea, Karagany is available on the underground market - though Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken this source code and modified it for its own use.
0.1050557417105900 We gathered and analyzed 88 variants of the Havex RAT used to gain access to, and harvest data from, networks and machines of interest.

0.572439743328863 "Given the recent high-profile reports of an FBI shutdown of CryptoLocker, it is worth remembering that whilst Cryptolocker has proven to be an extremely potent threat it is just one of several forms of ransomware, including Cryptowall and Cryptodefense.
0.517797010480407 Here are my tips to avoid having your computer infected with Cryptowall, or any other ransomware:
0.650126610152531 However, as of this publication, CryptoWall is thought to be controlled and used by a single threat group.
0.524119811298793 If the encrypted connection goes well, the communication with the Cryptowall Command & Control server will take places; otherwise the main thread sleeps for a random number of seconds and then retries with a new generated server name.
0.299829091636264 If you're "had", Cryptowall encrypts all the files that you possible could want to keep (images, documents, etc), and then asks for a 500$ ransom.
0.727304488379245 In another recently released report, anti-virus provider Bitdefender noted that cybercriminals were using help files as a way of infecting devices with a variant of the ransomware known as CryptoWall.

0.416630029251313 Researchers from Trend Micro discovered that a targeted attack against a government agency in Taiwan was conducted using a variant of the PlugX remote access tool (RAT) which abuses the popular file hosting service Dropbox.
0.36784133022246 Since then, PLUGX variants have been using other applications to hide their tracks from antimalware software.
0.556612838200090 Szappanos, who has followed Plugx samples for the past two years, posited that the group deploying Plugx must have made the first attempt, which failed to execute properly.
0.3854627473606816 Taiwanese government entity which used a variant of the PlugX RAT
0.584377491419716 The following are just some of the notable techniques they used: \u2022 Cloud-based file storage platform abuse: This June, threat actors used a Type II PlugX remote access tool (RAT) variant to be able to use Dropbox as a download site for a backdoor's command-and- control (C&C) settings.3 Abusing the cloud-based file storage platform allowed threat actors to better evade detection despite the implementation of network traffic monitoring.
0.1368571118890016 The PlugX instances analyzed by by researchers at Trend Micro have, identified as BKDR_PLUGX.ZTBF-A and TROJ_PLUGX.ZTBF-A, implements classic features of any other RAT, it installs a backdoor with that allows an attacker the complete control of compromised machines.
0.2461080898449112 The PlugX RAT is then loaded in the background without the user's knowledge.
0.135510339778860 The samples we obtained are detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_PLUGX.ZTBF-A and TROJ_PLUGX.ZTBF-A.
0.2491281545019212 The two types of malware belong to different categories of PlugX, the second one (TROJ_PLUGX.ZTBF-A,) is considered a new version which implements incorporates anti-forensic techniques, an authentication mechanism of the attacker, a different encryption algorithm, extended configuration, and more protocols and functions.
0.722904288895367 Threat analyst Maersk Menrige explained in a blog post that the attack, which was discovered in May, used the PlugX remote access tool (RAT) to target the Taiwanese government.
0.1173992916754278 When BKDR_PLUGX.ZTBF-A is executed, it performs various commands from a remote user, including keystroke logs, perform port maps, remote shell, etc., leading to subsequent attack cycle stages.
0.540582378371424 "With the information we have, we can say that this guy is behind the active development of the PlugX RAT," concludes AlienVault.
0.540029680533584 Armed with this backup mechanism, the miscreants responsible for Virut in theory would need simply to register one of the DGA-designated domains to be able to re-establish communications and control over the botnet..

0.707965213899871 By the end of the year, CERT Polska had used DNS sinkholes to take down the botnets Dorkbot, Virut, and Domain Silver, Inc., and any malware of interest using the Polish .pl domain space.
0.424518103351600 CERT Polska, a computer emergency response team in Poland that is run under the aegis of the country's Research and Academic Network (NASK), has announced takedown action against a raft of web servers associated with the Virut family of malware.
0.3744793309597137 However beware while taking a backup of your data files, malware like Virut (Virus + Trojan) can also infect executables (locally or on open SMB shares) by injecting its DNA and can infect HTML files by injecting malicious IFrames into them.
0.4104938984889827 In 2007, researchers at malware research group Team Furry published a brain dump of information that they'd collected about the individuals they believed created and ran the Virut botnet.
0.171983362753551 In late 2012 Symantec estimated the size of its botnet at 300,000 machines, while Kaspersky reported that Virut was responsible for 5.5% of infections in Q3 2012, making it the fifth most widespread threat of the time."
0.781974628623490 It aptly described how Virut worked: As a file-infecting virus that injected copies of itself into all .
0.511683541856311 NASK , the domain registrar that operates the ".pl" Polish top-level domain registry, said that on Thursday it began assuming control over 23 .pl domains that were being used to operate the Virut network.

0.671413681276499 The Exerevenue.com PPI program died off in 2010, but cached copies of the site offer a fascinating glimpse into the Virut business model.
0.632631848816212 The Virut botnet spreads through executable file infection (via infected USB sticks and other media), and through websites that use compromised HTML to infect vulnerable browsers.
0.2365459721595423 The Virut take down effort clearly illustrates the important and meaningful role registries and registrars can play in the fight against cyber crime in general.
0.072589974538285 These downloaders have been detected on computers in the GBOT and Virut botnets.
0.736889371372342 This bot has been aggressively establishing itself by seeding with another pay-per-install bot, Virut.
0.2223282927191624 Virut was responsible for 5.5% of infections in Q3 2012, making it the fifth most widespread threat of the time..
0.306006318262833 We draw this conclusion because all of the compromised computers we analyzed also had Trojan downloaders and other infamous Pay-per-Install (PPI) malware such as Win32/Virut .

0.196405893809577 A new strain of Vawtrak malware implements capabilities to send and receive data through encrypted favicons distributed over the Tor network.
0.568593591387215 A report released Thursday ( PDF ) by Sophos notes that while Neverquest, also known as Snifula and Vawtrak , is "neither technically ground-breaking nor innovative, it is an example of how banking malware can be used extremely effectively to achieve its goals.".
0.497244740399533 A VirusTotal search indicated that the URL was previously submitted and that the malware was vawtrak.
0.487956602457084 According to Trend Micro researchers, this latest Vawtrak spreading campaign comes in the form of fake FedEx and American Airlines emails that urge recipients to download the attached Microsoft Word file that supposedly contains details about a failed delivery or an airline ticket.
0.3276220043095353 An example of banking malware botnet is Vawtrak, also known as NeverQuest and Snifula.

0.4255398494833665 According to the screenshots above the new version of Blackhole focuses on evasion techniques: For example, in the code above the PDF and the Jar files are loaded using a unique link that is generated specifically for the user and is valid only for a limited amount of time (definitely a pain in the ass\u2026).
0.241706373501451 Advanced custom malware - Commoditised - Combine rapid incorporation of 0-day exploits into exploit kits, the exploit kit market growth, custom ATS scripts, new features in Blackhole and you have the beginnings of a commodity market for advanced custom malware, it's the next evolution.
0.1742711174337072 After infecting more than a half-million machines across more than 100 countries, you were shown to be running your hacking operation like a very organized and professional business, replete with paid staff, customer service personnel -- even a marketing director to promote Blackshades.
0.640486033187057 "After studying a series of samples we managed to focus on BlackEnergy 3 (the third generation of the BlackEnergy family of malwares), which incorporates a mechanism that seems to be designed for this purpose," the CyberX report said.
0.310524249227669 Again Darkleech was up to its tricks, injecting URLs and sending victims to a landing page belonging to the Blackhole Exploit Kit, one of the most popular and effective exploit kits available today.
0.556678422135349 Alex Yucel, 24, the alleged co-author of the Blackshades remote access Trojan (RAT) and owner-operator of the BlackShades organization, pleaded not guilty Thursday to multiple cybercrime charges levied against him last week as part of a major FBI sting that netted more than 90 other arrests.

0.19923211960122 Already, criminals who were considering using Blackshades have sought out different tools that are a bit less popular in the hopes that they can still achieve their malicious goal without the greater risk of being busted by the FBI.
0.3683319076025235 Also, Sophos noted that in the Windows 8 version of Internet Explorer, plugins are now disabled by default, blocking a major target for exploit kits and BlackHole attacks.
0.2387457107903161 Also, there are indications that this exploit will soon be rolled into the BlackHole exploit kit .
0.395528098011782 Also, we've mentioned in our previous post of a better way to handle the black hole exploit kit than focusing at the infection point.
0.539837240687271 Although inexpensive, the Blackshades RAT has an extensive set of capabilities such as keystroke logger, web cam control, full file access, etc. More than enough for the cyber attacker to assume the full identity of the owner of the compromised computer to allow them easy access to the business critical servers inside the data center as depicted in the diagram.
0.648388746606125 Although several other "technically sophisticated" techniques were used in the attacks iSIGHT investigated, the malware that extracted payment card information from POS systems is dubbed "Trojan.POSRAM" and correlates strongly with another POS malware known as "BlackPOS," according to the report.
0.633552460425783 Although the Java exploit we researched is part of the g01pack exploit kit, it is interesting to note that some implementation details are similar to the exploit used by BlackHole for CVE-2012-1723, identified in mid-2012 (described in a ).
0.0508247768556802 Although these intrusions have been identified and are widely attributed to Russia's government, there are several others whose attribution to the Russian Federation is less clear like MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, BlackEnergy Bot, SandWorm, and Quedagh.
0.0718914209774493 Although this trend is not new, the last version (version nature, for people to act not only through traditional protests where 2.0) of Blackhole -a well known exploit kit- proves that attackers they are physically present, but also express their discontent using a actively incorporate new exploits and functionalities with the purpose variety of electronic media.
0.1605024204595778 Among the exploits being used by Sandworm Team to deliver BlackEnergy and gain footholds in organizations is CVE-2014-4114 , a zero-day vulnerability in Windows OLE that impacts multiple versions of the operating system and could enable remote code execution.
0.718590468226116 Among the most common ways it reaches user systems are: infected removable drives, or the user has visited sites compromised with the Blackhole Exploit Kit.
0.402848551129979 Among those arrested in the CarderProfit sting was Michael Hogue , the alleged co-creator of Blackshades.
0.490840975804570 Amongst the many interesting sections of the report is a discusson of the notorious Blackhole exploit kit, which we have written about frequently on Naked Security..
0.635647285919293 An advertisement for a cracked version of Blackshades on a overworld hacker forum.
0.489497251852382 An Internet search on the unique malware "hash" signature noted in Trend's malware writeup indicates that the new BlackPOS verison was created on June 22, 2014 , and that as late as Aug. 15, 2014 only one of more than two-dozen anti-malware tools (McAfee) detected it as malicious.
0.584533786155656 An out-of-the-blue tweet from a Dutch researcher kicked off an unprecedented 24-hour rumor mill yesterday concerning the arrest of Paunch, a hacker allegedly behind the notorious Blackhole Exploit Kit.
0.33098867619701 and because Blackhole has an updatable framework and already has a foothold on thousands of sites, we anticipate that the number of sites compromised with this new zero-day will escalate rapidly in the coming days," he Malware peddlers have also begun their efforts to drive traffic to those domains, as witnessed by a slew of emails purportedly coming from the Dutch branch of the accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward, trying to trick people into following the offered link with news that the VAT rate will increase starting on October 1, 2012.
0.201505988270920 And here is a prime example of just how targeted this advertising can be: The most common reason miscreants purchase Internet traffic is to redirect it to sites they've retrofitted with exploit kits like Blackhole.
0.3882066900935644 And obviously, the overlap we've seen for a while now too, the exploits work their way from zero-day targeted attacks, and then turn around a few weeks later and that same exploit is now in BlackHole exploit kit.
0.755572434980719 And the exploit is expected to show up if it hasn't already in the widely used BlackHole exploit toolkit, one of the most popular threats on the web.
0.2153449276629919 And then, for the finishing blow, the applicants receive a positive response from "NATO", informing them that they are invited to "contact Director of training institute via email: ( ) are responding to the same IPs that a number of fake domains (meant to impersonate PayPal, the FBI, eBay, and others) are, and all are redirecting to sites hosting the Blackhole exploit kit and other client side exploits.
0.4197173562058278 And this exercise could be an ongoing trend, fraud experts predict, as more breaches linked to malware, such as BlackPOS, take aim at the retail and hospitality industries.
0.432211082835396 Andrew Komarov, CEO at cyber intelligence company IntelCrawler, has been investigating the BlackPOS malware since March 2013.
0.1877539938523955 Andrew Komarov , CEO of the cybercrime intelligence firm IntelCrawler, says the malware strain known as BlackPOS behind the Target attack and likely the Neiman Marcus attack has been linked to at least six other retailers.
0.1670478139257279 Another Crimeware group, the Sandworm Team , believed to have used the BlackEnergy exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and included custom plugin and scripts of their own.
0.1811538175759139 Another fake email posing as a Twitter account confirmation linked victims to a Russian website which housed a Blackhole exploit kit.
0.440394139669288 Apparently, the cause was something similar to BlackPOS, the malicious program that already helped criminals breach the Target Corporation and Neiman Marcus last year.
0.267375213631577 Around this time in 2013, the most commonly used exploit kit - the Blackhole Exploit Kit - was shut down after its creator, Paunch, was arrested by law enforcement.

0.597098091467408 As far as Blackshades being done with, it's possible that a lack of interest due to the high profile of this malware might drive away a large portion of the market, in which case Blackshades won't be updated and it's functionality will become obsolete.
0.3828098158833772 As for Blackhole, there are still a handful of attack groups using it, but Kafeine said that he has seen about a 98 percent drop in the usage of that exploit kit since the arrest of Paunch.
0.2313205536166391 As for the files themselves, we will publish a technical analysis of the PDF and Jar exploits served by the new version of Blackhole in a later blog post.
0.686643269853268 As it is, notes KrebsonSecurity , Blackhole is currently the most prevalent exploit kit in use.

0.0918542084108606 As one of the primary names behind Blackhole, Paunch kept the toolkit current as new weaknesses in commonly used programs were discovered: in 2012 Paunch released Blackhole 2.0 , and recent custom versions of the toolkit incorporated ways to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Java's browser plugin .
0.616868192411063 As predicted, since his arrest in early October, the two kits - of which Blackhole was the most used one - stopped receiving updates and the exploits they wielded got stale, making the kits a way less effective tools than before.
0.787512848061301 As previously reported , the breach appears to have been carried out using an off-the-shelf malware known as BlackPOS - which may have also been involved in the Neiman Marcus attack.
0.352320047638145 As reported in the Cisco 2014 Midyear Security Report , when Paunch-the alleged creator and distributor of the Blackhole exploit kit-was arrested in Russia in late 2013, other malware creators wanted to fill the gap.
0.63056722654073 As said above, the whole range of tools, plugins, and other components of BlackEnergy is still undefined.
0.345308254504125 As the FBI reported in the criminal complaint , the nastyware that turned up in the search of his computers and the analysis of his electronic slime trail included evidence of keylogging, plus messages relating to the use of two remote-access tools (RATs) or Trojans - Blackshades and Darkcomet - which can be used to control victims' computers, including turning on a computer's camera.
0.398425718137322 As usual with all things Russian in the Cybercrime world, Brian Krebs broke the story in the US with Meet Paunch the Accused Author of the Blackhole Exploit Kit , which provided photos of a character believed to be Paunch.

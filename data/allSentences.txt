0.723066755847084 However, as the cyber threat becomes ever more frequent and sophisticated, the potential to compromise critical systems and cause real world damage grows – and notorious viruses such as Stuxnet and Flame have highlighted the cascading effect that an attack can have on other infrastructure sectors.
0.225619270102374 However, focus on ICS security had not been slumbering until Stuxnet hit the headlines.
0.568686102588219 Hyppönen ( left ), the widely respected chief research officer at Sweden's F-Secure, says what is often missing in this story is whether Stuxnet actually killed people.
0.332207395890671 Hyppönen was involved in the investigation on Stuxnet, and he discovered that was possible to make a reverse engineering of the detected samples to build new agents and hit new types of targets.
0.538935976546373 Hypponen highlighted a number of malware samples widely thought to have been produced by the U.S. government, namely Stuxnet and Flame , though he emphasized that government entities around the globe are currently deploying malware against other countries' politicians and even citizens.
0.0823067540335551 I can't remember which journalist or antivirus researcher first mentioned power plants (some of which certainly do run WinCC) in connection with Stuxnet.
0.1056900068317309 I have heard stuxnet labeled both sophisticated and unsophisticated.
0.4767499435766231 I have said for years that the Stuxnet story marked the beginning of a new era for the cyber security community.
0.78711018220245 I not agree this school of thought, Stuxnet is the demonstration that an agent can get out of control, out of the cage, and could attack also machines of the country of its creators, don't forget that cyberspace has no boundaries.
0.1916605465183903 Ian's FARS news agency reported the news -- far-fetched as it may sound -- that Stuxnet version 2 was discussed at a meeting between the two sides on November 24 in Vienna.

0.515961583678632 "If Gauss came after Stuxnet, it's clear the authors disliked the publicity its PLC [programmable logic controller] payload received and made an effort to hide it properly the second time.".
0.69640375194938 If it follows a similar infection vector to the original Stuxnet tho, we probably would hear of it due to the massive Windows infections that precede the attacks on the industrial systems.
0.296845491861843 If the news is confirmed the news is very concerning, Stuxnet had infected the internal network of a Russian nuclear plant, exactly in the same way it compromised the control system in Iranian nuclear facilities in Natanz .
0.137376478418229 If these reports are confirmed, they would be enough to make small changes to Stuxnet effective against systems of North Korea.
0.4539403164041717 In 2010, the Stuxnet computer worm was identified as the first-ever cyber-weapon to attack a particular industrial target.
0.322978728400855 In addition to fixing the LNK file vulnerability that allowed Stuxnet to infect machines when a stick was plugged in, company engineers have also reworked the autorun feature that used to automatically open a window each time a removable drive was connected.

0.764170704081118 In fact, some experts say that Stuxnet could well have been far more effective and difficult to detect had the attackers not made a few elementary mistakes.
0.394744414195858 In fact well over 1,000 binaries have been flagged by various vendors as Stuxnet over the past few months.

0.0684053047521827 In the case of Stuxnet it was hard to modify the code related to the attack against industrial SCADA control systems, but anyway the malware could be adapted to send malicious commands to an infected industrial plant that could cause serious damages.
0.1090081965962214 In the end, Stuxnet may have knocked Iran's progress towards a nuclear weapon off by five years or more - part of a program to "run the clock" on Iran.
0.511882784091066 In the more than two years that has passed since Stuxnet was discovered during the summer of 2010, the malware's complexity and goal of causing damage in the physical world has led to multiple efforts to peel back all of the layers of Stuxnet's existence.
0.793573095466620 In the past, he has been critical of both the media coverage of the Stuxnet worm and of Siemens response to revelations that software vulnerabilities and other structural weaknesses in its products contributed to the creation of Stuxnet and the success of the attack.
0.750772125571798 In their new book, Fallout: The True Story of the CIA's Secret War on Nuclear Trafficking, they posit that Stuxnet is just the latest in a years-long effort by the U.S. and its allies to prevent nuclear proliferation.
0.750377899971589 In this case, the Iranian government might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat.

0.646343975090117 Indications on the presence of a state-sponsored attack are related to the target addressed and the region where the agent has counted the greater number of infected host, let's think for example to Flame that hit mainly Middle Eastern countries with cyber espionage intents or Stuxnet that concentrated its efficacy against Iranian nuclear plants..

0.725670503796086 Iran has significantly increased its attacks on Israel's infrastructure as retaliation for the Stuxnet virus in 2009, which is believed to be developed by Israel and United States which infected country's nuclear facilities.

0.514860173962260 It also patched a serious kernel mode driver vulnerability that could enable attackers to gain root access to a machine using a malicious USB drive, a la Stuxnet.
0.571962002941021 It is also possible to follow the manual instructions given by Microsoft for the original Stuxnet vulnerability to disable the display of icons for LNK files.
0.509604026792943 It is believed to be related to Stuxnet, the computer worm developed by the U.S. and Israel to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.
0.562466999390944 It is hard to explain why a less aggressive version of Stuxnet was deployed eventually.
0.760927901931712 It is most likely that Stuxnet was intended to affect the motors that drive uranium enrichment centrifuges.
0.2168291525048653 It is notable that the first definitions that the major anti-virus firms shipped for the Stuxnet malware were on or around the same day as my story, and that this malware was first discovered one month earlier by VirusBlokada, a relatively tiny anti-virus firm in Belarus that said it found the worm on computers belonging to one its Iranian customers.
0.415836006655355 It is this nuance which made Stuxnet so sophisticated, given its ability to target highly specific industrial processes and the field devices (PLC's), which were associated with nuclear enrichment.
0.1982679345026178 It looks like North Korea's "hermit nation" status has paid off in at least one way: the US was unable to infect the systems controlling centrifuges for North Korea's nuclear program, even after using a variant of the Stuxnet virus designed specifically for Korean systems.
0.508913006440872 It originally targeted power-plant control systems as the Stuxnet worm and then appeared in more mainstream malware because it was an unpatched vulnerability with working exploit code.
0.1600100344138476 "It seems to me Equation Group are the ones with the coolest toys," Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, told Ars. "Every now and then they share them with the Stuxnet group and the Flame group, but they are originally available only to the Equation Group people. Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame."
0.515772355942926 It should be kept in mind that, in addition to affecting motors, Stuxnet included espionage functionality and collected information on STEP 7 projects found on infected systems.
0.1622500434641309 It too was attacked multiple times-once in 2009 and twice more in 2010 by all three Stuxnet variants.
0.430044914918541 "It took a nation-state or two to create Stuxnet, utilizing some of the best engineers and analysts in the world, and the community has never seen anything like that before or since, yet defeating that type of threat is what most people are concerned with," Lee said.
0.3938376445553396 "It was 20 times more sophisticated than Stuxnet," with thousands of lines of code that took a large team, ample funding and months, if not years, to develop, he said.
0.188661479030277 It was a component that didn't fit with the malware, according to Liam O Murchu, manager of North American operations for Symantec Security Technology & Response, who in February detailed Symantec's discovery of what it nicknamed "Stuxnet 0.5" that dates back to 2005, five years before later and better-known version of the malware that was discovered in 2010.
0.791156044250602 "It was actually so similar, that it made our automatic system classify it as Stuxnet.
0.0831131637440207 It was WinCC that was cracked to allow the Stuxnet attack on the Iranian centrifuges; and vulnerabilities still exist.
0.64752996706651 It's been a fair while since we've heard a mention of Stuxnet , so the potential for Stuxnet 2 is quite interesting.
0.660096775115335 It's definitively more complex than Stuxnet and Flame when it comes to the design of the platform, functionality, or flexibility," says Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab.
0.352938491959903 "It's difficult to do a destructive attack online," Coviello said. "Even the attack on Iran ( Stuxnet ) required some level of manual intervention to pull that off; you couldn't do it remotely. You don't have to have destruction to have a serious problem. If an attack is successful enough, you can have disruption with significant financial consequences that result in a loss of confidence that is out of proportion with the financial loss in question."
0.373335149365973 It's infects USB sticks with a data stealing component that exploit the LNK (CVE-2010-2568) vulnerability, the same used by Stuxnet and Flame.
0.437436004668677 It's no reach to say that there will be more Stuxnet or Flame-style attacks in the coming year.
0.467679625850424 "It's nothing like Stuxnet," he says, explaining that this is a more generalized threat as opposed to one laser-focused on one target, "but it's confirmation that all those things people have been telling you is true.
0.4193053957752709 It's thought that Pyongyang's nuclear program uses similar hardware and software to that of Iran, so the tweaks needed to make Stuxnet work in the hermit nation would not have required much time or money.
0.1390123393391563 Javadi said that the indigenous anti-virus is actually able to detect the virus such as Stuxnet and Flame and to clean up the infected computers..
0.04394104687815314 Joe Cordaro, advisory engineer with SRNL, says the PFP system right away found Stuxnet on the PLC, before the infamous malware began to activate -- while it was dormant on the PLC.
0.0752439129830482 Just a short notice and heads-up to all - the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046 which deals with the LNK vulnerability originally exploited by Stuxnet is now out.
0.43513285238888 Kaspersky found a privilege escalation exploit that was used in Stuxnet being used by the Fanny worm.
0.0729958340600929 Kaspersky Lab has uncovered what appears to be one of the most sophisticated cyber-attack groups in history - in operation for at least 14 years and which even had access to some of the exploits used in the Stuxnet and Flame campaigns.
0.720543266796367 Kaspersky Lab said it was an attack on Behpajooh in March 2010 that led to Stuxnet "leaking" into the wild after it infected other organizations in Iran and then elsewhere around the world - ultimately leading to its public discovery.
0.55852749192274 Kaspersky officials first became suspicious their network might be infected in the weeks following February's Security Analyst Summit , where company researchers exposed a state-sponsored hacking operation that had ties to some of the developers of Stuxnet.
0.759742924683951 Kaspersky researchers call Bahpajooh "Patient Zero," leading to the widest distribution of Stuxnet.

0.224788395299621 Langner also speculates that Stuxnet was not built to escape beyond Natanz's walls, yet it did, likely through contractors who worked at the plant leaving with laptops infected with Stuxnet and plugging them in at other industrial facilities where they were contracted.
0.668603674540642 Langner enumerates three types of exploits used by Stuxnet - only one category of which (Windows operating system exploits) have been closed.
0.314217365484260 Langner points a finger at the National Security Agency as the authors of Stuxnet, calling it the only logical location for its development.
0.466220705070179 Langner reiterated his ongoing concern that governments and industry are not doing enough to protect themselves against cyber-threats like Stuxnet that could be used to damage real-world infrastructure.
0.3227881412093601 Langner said that the media paid too much attention to the four, zero day Windows vulnerabilities that enabled the Stuxnet worm, but overlooked the other security holes used by the worm.
0.786451368585626 Langner said this category of vulnerability "opens the door to extremely aggressive attacks that do not have to be nearly as surgical as it (sp) was seen in Stuxnet." .
0.447433356589640 Langner told Dark Reading that the early version of Stuxnet would not have been detected if the attackers had taken more pains to cover their tracks.
0.726711658294736 Lawson concludes that whoever wrote Stuxnet likely was constrained by time and didn't think there was enough of a return to justify the investment of more time in advanced cloaking techniques.
0.181278526838698 Let us recall Stuxnet , Flame and other high-tech "weapons."
0.2172370002376028 Let's remind that according the analysis on Flame source code conducted by Kaspersky the malware is linked to Stuxnet, a version of the famous virus shared a module with the spy toolkit.
0.4972439154845408 Level of awareness and government commitment : Before the Stuxnet case, world wide security community has always underestimated the possible effect of a cyber offensive, in many cases refusing the concept of cyber weapon .
0.74499989455968 Like later versions, Stuxnet 0.5 was programmed to attack only equipment containing labels found in Iran's Natanz facility, presumably to prevent malfunctions in other plants.
0.2672210832361886 Like Stuxnet and many other pieces of malware used in the last five years, Mask code was digitally signed, in this case with a valid certificate issued to a fake company called TecSystem Ltd. Such digital credentials are designed to bypass warnings delivered by Windows and other operating systems before executing programs that haven't been vouched for by credentials issued by a recognized certificate authority.
0.4546290209676764 Like Stuxnet , Shamoon and Flame , Narilam seems to primarily target Iran.
0.340138835067589 Like Stuxnet, the threat uses a driver file signed with a legitimate digital certificate, in this case issued by Taiwan-based C-Media Electronics, according to F-Secure.
0.4285238645273743 lnk") was being exploited by highly targeted malicious software called "Stuxnet".
0.2065313852912907 Looking at the financial and R&D investment required and combining this with the fact that there's no obvious money-making mechanism within Stuxnet, that leaves only two possibilities: a terror group or a nation-state.
0.753005384154548 Luis - One of the main stories to emerge this year in the world of security has been Stuxnet, malware with unique characteristics, such as the inclusion of several 0-day exploits, or the fact that it targets certain SIEMENS systems used in nuclear power stations.
0.3793262736661282 Malicious Web sites sprung up to capitalize on everything from the World Cup to the Stuxnet worm, while reports noted SEO campaigns pushing traffic to fake search engines and malicious Android mobile applications.
0.625981974893190 Malware authors have been using this technique for several years and it has been seen in a number of high-level attacks, including Stuxnet .
0.0759074414355828 Many suspect Stuxnet was the work of Israeli intelligence.
0.4387150881987885 "Many would certainly disagree with me, but I do consider Stuxnet an APT. It's not really an APT by the classic definition pushed by many security pundits, but it's definitely an advanced attack that required the use by the adversary of multiple tactics and intelligence sources, and it's specifically targeted, so it needs to be treated with the same sort of defensive approach and cyberdoctrine as an APT," he says.
0.3488863068457147 Mark James, technical director of ESET UK, points to Stuxnet as a significant milestone in malware development, as it transitions from its data-stealing origins to more intricate deployments.
0.457458360097045 "Maybe it's a side effect of the encrypted payload that no one will be able to copy and paste the code like they could with Stuxnet.
0.588783948211239 Microsoft also patched the last of the zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by the infamous Stuxnet computer worm.
0.2363507704030697 Microsoft's disclosure follows Friday's revelation that the George W. Bush and Obama administrations developed and deployed Stuxnet, the highly advanced software used to set back the Iranian nuclear program by sabotaging uranium centrifuges at Iran's Natanz refining facility.
0.490036070111860 More Commentary " Most Popular On the Web Most Popular Forget Standardization -- Embrace BYOD CrowdStrike Gets $30M In New Round Of Funding How To Conduct An Effective IT Security Risk Assessment Stuxnet Expert Proposes New Framework For ICS/SCADA Security More Popular " On the Web "Stop spy on us!"
0.438550717379511 More importantly, it's grossly premature to compare these attacks to Stuxnet , the highly sophisticated malware the US and Israel designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program , or to declare the spate of attacks " Financial Armageddon ."
0.255424130090234 More typical, they say, are experiences of Dillon Beresford, who last year uncovered a slew of vulnerabilities in the same Siemens PLCs targeted by the Stuxnet worm .
0.31651663560525 Most AV companies had Stuxnet-specific detection by now, of course.
0.615229789456133 "Most utilities did not indicate how many of the voluntary cybersecurity measures related to Stuxnet, Aurora and remote access threat they have implemented.
0.636904851374841 Motivated by economic and political aims, some of the most advanced cyber attacks are designed to steal information (or, like Stuxnet, sabotage critical infrastructure) and evade detection.
0.258955627730973 Mozilla has gone a step further , asking all of the Firefox CAs audit their security systems, and at least one researcher has made the argument that the attack on DigiNotar may end up being bigger than Stuxnet .
0.299522372187070 Much has been written about Stuxnet in the last six months, with researchers settling on centrifuges used for uranium enrichment fairly early in the analysis of the worm.
0.0674929204727058 "Much has been written about the failure of Stuxnet to destroy a substantial number of centrifuges, or to significantly reduce Iran's LEU production. While that is undisputable, it doesn't appear that this was the attackers' intention," he pointed out. "If catastrophic damage was caused by Stuxnet, that would have been by accident rather than by purpose. The attackers were in a position where they could have broken the victim's neck, but they chose continuous periodical choking instead."
0.2464018246850587 Much of the earlier controversy about the origin and targeting of Stuxnet derived from uncertainty about exactly what its code was meant to do.
0.405243692376026 Naked Security writer Paul Ducklin did try to temper the hysteria at the time in his article, Stuxnet?
0.585796701234678 Namely, malicious attackers are more likely to make the process control systems "misbehave" while remaining operational -- much like Stuxnet aimed to do.
0.0567296387133026 Natanz facility, which were reportedly crippled by the Stuxnet
0.591305201610908 Natanz uranium enrichment facility infected by Stuxnet
0.752937464419468 Nate Lawson, a cryptographer and expert on the security of embedded systems, said in a blog post Monday that the Stuxnet authors were very naive in the methods they used to cloak the payload and target of the malware.
0.520908459138831 Neda was attacked only once, in July 2009, and Stuxnet never left that organization, according to the infection logs available to us.
0.1835186186901475 New and important evidence found in the sophisticated "Stuxnet" malware targeting industrial control systems provides strong hints that the code was designed to sabotage nuclear plants, and that it employs a subtle sabotage strategy that involves briefly speeding up and slowing down physical machinery at a plant over a span of weeks.
0.211025373949227 Newly revealed cyber espionage attack 'More complex' than Stuxnet, Flame.

0.2911610666779803 Noticeably absent from Stuxnet was any kind of mechanism preventing researchers, enemies, or potential copycat programmers from peering inside the malware to see what the highly selective payload did.
0.2904981157140731 Noting that Symantec in early 2011 had established that Stuxnet, widely considered the first cyber weapon, was distributed through five organizations, Kaspersky researchers said they combed through 2,000 files collected over two years to "identify the organizations that were the first victims of the worm's different variants in 2009 and 2010.".
0.684789438283725 Noting the history of Tocy.a and its initial designation as a Stuxnet variant, the researchers probed deeper into why the companies artificial intelligence saw the two pieces of malicious code as so similar to each other, but not to other samples from Kaspersky's massive library of malware.
0.650462356475817 Now more and more attacks are becoming visible and reported (e.g. Stuxnet like 'Havex' malware strikes European SCADA Systems - June 2014) and whether they are a terrorist attack such as the data destruction attacks on Saudi Aramco and on Qatar's RasGas gas company in 2012 or unintentional (the vast majority of reported cyber incidents are 'accidental in nature' as reported by the Repository of Industrial security incidents, 2011), billions of dollars are lost every year because of them.
0.0634007881588638 Now, not only was it back with updated Stuxnet-derived malware that spied on Iran, it was also escalating its campaign with a brazen strike on Kaspersky.
0.469149973094307 Now, with attacks like Stuxnet proof of the risk, the big question is: How will industry respond?
0.314187604408618 "NSM would have caught" Stuxnet, says Sistrunk, senior consultant with Mandiant's ICS practice.
0.311921584582779 Obama officials are taking a significant political gamble by admitting to creating Stuxnet.
0.796981648687788 O'Connell is particularly concerned about the use of Stuxnet, the virus that disrupted operations at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility, now believed to have been a US/Israeli project: "I am also concerned about how the Chinese are using the internet for military advantage," she warns.
0.699453066312126 Of the remaining three attacks, one was exploited by Stuxnet and another was exploited by Conficker, the virulent worm discovered in 2008 that has infected millions of computers (and reportedly continues to do so ).
0.469911638787127 Officials have yet to determine whether the virus is a prank or was generated by Iran's cyberwarfare program, which had been rapidly expanded since Tehran's nuclear program was hit by the Stuxnet virus in 2010.
0.71110686081796 O'Murchu said there's no way of knowing if Stuxnet 0.5 ever carried out the highly advanced attack on the Siemens 417 controllers inside Natanz.
0.1545891249816221 On June 1, the New York Times reported that President Obama, since the early months of his presidency, ordered increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks on Iranian computer systems to cripple nuclear enrichment centrifuges as part of a major expansion of America's first persistent use of cyberweapons [see Report: Obama Ordered Stuxnet Assault ].
0.142444021262304 On the first anniversary of Stuxnet, Roel Schouwenberg discusses gaping holes in Industrial Control Systems and the risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
0.57045394114473 On the other hand, it may simply mean that the group was familiar enough with the modus operandi characteristic of SCADA sites to gamble on the likelihood that Stuxnet would hit enough poorly-defended, poorly-patched and poorly- regulated PLCs to gain them the information and control they wanted.
0.1558716519797789 On Tuesday, HP published a blog post on Microsoft's first "failed" Stuxnet fix, MS10-046, the same day the tech giant released MS15-020 , a critical patch that would thwart similar exploitation.
0.221042833089629 on which Stuxnet was developed, Gauss is based on the 'Flame' platform," the researchers .
0.0920400054711069 One example is that cyberattacks on infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet attacks on Iranian nuclear fuel processing machinery, can cause physical damage.
0.4000728239893066 One example of the difficulty of keeping air-gapped environments secure involved the nuclear enrichment centrifuges at Iran's secure Natanz facility, which were reportedly crippled by the Stuxnet virus despite the centrifuges being connected only to an air-gapped network.
0.6686426688380 One of his most alarming statements, and one which has been discussed thoroughly by Kaspersky Lab researchers and speakers , was "Stuxnet is the rubicon of our future".
0.551308278495644 One of the key infection methods for the Stuxnet worm was hard-coded to stop working on June 24, removing one of its techniques for propagation.
0.517384006371782 One of those apparent links lie in similarities between the Fanny worm, which has been used by the Equation group since at least 2008, and the Stuxnet worm, which according to multiple news articles and books that cite unnamed U.S. government sources, has been developed by the NSA and Israel's intelligence services.
0.229138407389638 One precedent is November 2010's attack on Iran's centrifuges, believed to have originated from a joint U.S. and Israel campaign dubbed Stuxnet .
0.2777709283537479 "Operation Myrtus required one or two geniuses to design Stuxnet," he warns. "Understanding and copying the design can be achieved by average engineers. Even worse, the design AND PRODUCTION process can be packaged into a software tool , enabling immoral idiots and geniuses alike to configure highly aggressive cyber weapons."
0.129328604011021 Operators at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility might well have caught Stuxnet before it spread and sabotaged operations at the plant if they had been watching the wires for anomalous network traffic, a pair of ICS/SCADA experts say.
0.395294747327553 Or at least they wouldn't have seen this, if information about Stuxnet hadn't been released last July.
0.454595413994551 Others, notably researchers at Kaspersky Lab, have suggested that both Flame and Stuxnet may be of a similar origin, even though they are separate programs.
0.709837868065379 Our detection for this new binary is Rootkit: W32/Stuxnet.
0.705426282835715 Out of this was borne the Stuxnet cyber-weapon, which was designed to specifically target the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility in Iran.
0.554089157707920 Over the years many cyber weapons have been identified as described the most famous of which is the virus Stuxnet, for its development is common opinion that has been involved, by US and Israel Governments, a pool of high specialists.

0.1308428914899283 Since it was first detected just over a year ago, Stuxnet has been analyzed in detail.
0.299150371095849 Since Stuxnet, plenty of attention has been focused on the security of SCADA and industrial control systems.
0.1643976926212833 Since the discovery of Stuxnet the ICS/SCADA community has come under intense scrutiny from the security industry.
0.67174572065382 Since there is no defense they are often thought to be used primarily against high profile, high value targets (such as the zero-days used against Google and others in the Aurora attacks, the four zero-days used in the Stuxnet attacks on Iran, and the zero-day used in the RSA SecurID attack).
0.72914304622329 So does Stuxnet infect these Vacon and Fararo Paya drives?
0.512383724795420 So far in our series about Stuxnet we've focussed on the main issue: the threat posed by the zero-day vulnerability in the processing of LNK files, and the fact that cybercriminals have somehow got their hands on digital certificates.
0.630948510798865 So far, the only software-based attack that has been attributed to the US (though never officially acknowledged by the US government) has been the Stuxnet virus , which was reportedly codeveloped with Israeli intelligence to disable production equipment in an Iranian nuclear facility.
0.790726933639955 So when they would be attacked, it would probably take a year until they notice, which is exactly what we have seen in the case of Stuxnet.

0.58029223463121 The target is there, and I think with the press around Stuxnet and a lot of the independent research that has started to bubble up around control system vulnerability since then, it's getting attention from the cyber security community and also from the hacking communities.
0.3974297815710824 The term "critical infrastructure" has earned its spot on the board of our ongoing game of cyber bingo-right next to "Digital Pearl Harbor," "Cyber 9/11," "SCADA" and "Stuxnet.".
0.345715152122647 "[The United States has] shown that they work, that they're cheap, and they are deniable," he told Ars on Friday, pointing out that one of Stuxnet's main advantages was that even years after its deployment, it still had plausible deniability by American officials.

0.526632193443948 The US and Israel are widely believed to be behind the Stuxnet Trojan in 2010, which took aim at Iran's nuclear program by invading and compromising a uranium enrichment facility at Nantanz, shutting down centrifuges .
0.506586754912693 The U.S. are one of the most advanced country under cyber warfare perspective, we have read a lot on its capabilities and its offensive power, to remark some sample we can remind the plan-X project and the development of the cyber weapon Stuxnet .

0.757784273968310 There really isn't anything funny or entertaining about the Stuxnet attack.
0.732989703235330 Therefore I am not surprised by a 2010 CVE that Stuxnet is using, is still viable," says Barry Sheitman, director of security strategy at Imperva.
0.69492555180092 There's a couple of new developments in the Stuxnet rootkit case.
0.4953154632290721 There's no doubt that Stuxnet was a sophisticated attack.
0.4882092345265930 These are the groups responsible for the majority of the attacks such as Flame , Stuxnet , Red October and while those attacks sometimes are conflated with run-of-the-mill cybercrime operations designed to steal credit card numbers.

0.4618342652828474 "This is the end of plausible deniability on Stuxnet," said Chris Bronk, a former State Department official, who is now a research fellow at Rice University. "Cyber is a dangerous place to play. This makes me very nervous that we don't understand the entire set of consequences of releasing malware into the wild."
0.449702142243853 This particular version was subjected to the most detailed analysis by anti-malware companies.</p> Shortly afterwards, when news of Stuxnet had already become widespread, files related to its June 2009 incarnation were detected.

0.2192621769708317 This week U.S. officials warned that going forward a new variant of Stuxnet could take aim toward "broader installations" of programmable equipment in control systems.
0.4051822821167476 This will be not only as a result of "whistle blowing" revelations, but also due to the fallout from major risk scenarios playing out on many levels, affecting countries (Stuxnet virus) and businesses (the Target breach of credit and debit card data from as many as 40 million customers), not to mention the theft of $450 million of Bitcoins from the Mt. Gox exchange (which filed for bankruptcy as a result).
0.2941958646081026 Those same centrifuges, we now known, were the primary target of the Stuxnet worm, which is believed to have disabled a good part of Iran's nuclear enrichment operation and set the country's progress towards a bomb back by years.
0.660331327865402 Though high-profile APTs like the highly sophisticated Stuxnet and Flame malware appear to target governments and political groups, other APTs are utilized for corporate espionage.
0.387524441173270 Though some have recently argued that criminal malware is more advanced than some suspect, Stuxnet-a state sponsored threat-was vastly superior than any previously seen malware.
0.508041183172626 Thus, Stuxnet isn't just a rootkit that hides itself on Windows, but is the first publicly known rootkit that is able to hide injected code located on a PLC.
0.39552574569555 TMP extracts from its section with ".stub" name another component - the main dynamic link library of Stuxnet - then loads it and calls exported function number 15.
0.1073345588853159 To perform this trick, Stuxnet loads a specially crafted keyboard layout file, making it possible to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

0.4867112733651375 Today social media are spreading a shocking news, authors of Stuxnet virus that hit Iranian nuclear program in 2010 according a new research proposed by Symantec security company started in 2005 and contrary to successive instance of the malware he was designed to manipulate the nuclear facility's gas valves.
0.634868239795429 Today's bumper crop of updates for Windows and other Microsoft products doesn't just fix a new version of the Stuxnet shortcut attack .
0.4107923430123775 Toward the end of last week, a number of industry colleagues pointed me in the direction of some emerging news stories that cited the purported research of John Bumgarner of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit in Washington, D.C. The numerous articles covering his research suggest that the Conficker worm was unleashed by the perpetrators of Stuxnet in order to provide an initial entry vector onto Iranian systems located at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment plant, in addition to providing a smoke screen designed to "mask" the real nature of the operation.
0.399305634168690 Trend Micro has been protecting users from from all known STUXNET-related malware through the Trend Micro TM Smart Protection Network TM.

0.1545559008207252 Until now, most of the focus has been on the LNK/PIF vulnerability which Stuxnet exploits in order to spread via removable storage media and networks.
0.1313944222479885 "Until recently we only knew that the Stuxnet developers had access to the resources of Flamer," Thakur said. "However, the recent developments we released this week confirmed our suspicions that the Stuxnet and Flamer developers are indeed related. They're either part of the same team of developers, or they're part of separate teams, but operating within the same organization."
0.698795430604848 UPDATE: Why Stuxnet-Like Attacks Aren't Going Away.
0.077482678416866 US and Israel are widely believed to be behind the Stuxnet

0.558260002793659 U.S. government (together with the Israelis) was behind Stuxnet
0.658005170726987 Very few pieces of malware have garnered the same kind of worldwide attention as Stuxnet - the computer worm used as a cyber weapon to attack Iran's uranium enrichment facility in Natanz.
0.4670248959275138 Vulnerability exploited by Stuxnet still a threat.
0.693049612073518 Way more detail, and much more sobering to see that this group of malware goes all the way back to 2001, and includes code to map disconnected networks (using USB key C&C like Stuxnet did), as well as the disk firmware facet that's everyone's headline today.
0.613077658720561 We all believe the NSA created Stuxnet, so any confirmation of this won't surprise us.
0.1812628897780742 We also present some information on Stuxnet configuration data and its remote communication protocol with C&C servers.
0.777966426381596 We are quite excited about the book which includes new and previously undisclosed information about Stuxnet.
0.578035786701667 We blogged about what we found while we were investigating the malware; our Stuxnet series may have come to an end, but that doesn't mean we've stopped our research.
0.3346928939065194 We do this by comparing two outstanding examples of these two species of attack: Aurora and Stuxnet.
0.0951243478301373 We have a clear idea of the possible effects that a cyber weapon like Stuxnet could have on the critical infrastructure of a Western country.
0.1210107508312527 We have already seen several attacks targeted at certificates as well as specifically at software developers: \u25cf The Stuxnet worm has made use of digital certificates stolen from Chinese hardware manufacturers JMicron Technology Corp. and Realtek Semiconductor Corp. in order to install code onto computers it infected 31, 32, 33.
0.30314201581446 We have compared the two exploit implementations in Conficker and Stuxnet and found that the shell codes that have been used are different.
0.597315724866162 We have now obtained an earlier version of Stuxnet that contains the fully operational 417 PLC device attack code."
0.264725563766878 "We have seen some vulnerabilities go back to 2009-2010, and I suspect that we can find even older examples. Therefore I am not surprised by a 2010 CVE that Stuxnet is using, is still viable," says Barry Sheitman, director of security strategy at Imperva.
0.442441087549879 "We know now that Stuxnet and Flame remained hidden in their target networks for years - by the time worms like these do damage or steal trade secrets, it is too late to defend against them.".
0.522180988736404 We know that the authors of Stuxnet had intimate, insider-level knowledge of and likely physical access to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
0.769931585069184 "We were amazed when Stuxnet used four zero-days, but this group has been able to discover eight zero-days.

0.357487830700518 Weighing the risk and reward involved with the scenario, using a cyberattack against the Iranian nuclear facilities with Stuxnet seems like an easy decision, though the potential dark side of the decision -- other nation-states using cyberweapons in retaliation -- has been mentioned by the likes of retired USAF general Michael Hayden and other prominent figures.
0.420517806149152 What I essentially demonstrated was that while much of Stuxnet was highly sophisticated, it had several components that, unlike Conficker, were really poorly written.
0.328946077258634 What they're going to do with that information, potentially, is to create the new Stuxnet.".
0.38719122102227 "What we can conclude from this is that Stuxnet coders had access to Flamer source code, and they were originally using the Flamer source code for the Stuxnet project," said Liam O'Murchu, manager of operations for Symantec Security Response. "With version 0.5 of Stuxnet, we can say that the developers had access to the exact same code. They were not just using shared components. They were using the exact same code to build the projects. And then, at some point, the development [of Stuxnet and Flame] went in two different directions."
0.0501875873562683 What's more, use of a USB stick to infect an array of computer platforms at the BIOS level rivals the payload delivery system found in the state-sponsored Stuxnet worm unleashed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program .
0.639735986303750 When I heard about the discovery in respect to (Stuxnet variant) Tilded , I would say I was by no means surprised.
0.2010222791809390 When it came to actually carrying out Stuxnet's most insidious attack - changing the output of the S7 PLCs from the management software, the worm's authors didn't need to leverage a sophisticated hack.
0.0762478305827627 When Stuxnet happened, there was a lot of talk about how it had to be an insider, because a hacker can't just buy a control system and find the vulnerabilities and backdoors in order to build these types of attacks.
0.0685943016483648 When Stuxnet was made public in June 2010, a New York Times article contended that the worm was a creation of the United States and Israel to undermine Iran's nuclear program.
0.549872699685793 When tracking the chain of Stuxnet propagation, one of the group's branch organizations raises special interest: "Allegedly the controlling entity of Nedaye Micron Electronic Company in Tehran, Iran and Neda Overseas Electronics LLC in Dubai, UAE; provides services in industrial automation for power plants, the cement industry, and the oil, gas and petrochemical sector; established in the mid 1980s under the name NEDA Computer Products Incorporated as a fully private joint stock company" .
0.2072658472983435 When you inspect a flash USB drive infected with the Stuxnet worm you can expect to find 6 files there as on the following screenshot: Figure 3.10 - The Worm's Files on a USB Flash Drive Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; Copy of Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Shortcut to.lnk; ~WTR4141.
0.4211672275799922 Whereas Sanger's book focused on the US foreign policy implications of offensive cyber warfare using government insiders as the main source, Zetter's book fills in the technical story behind the attacks by interviewing everybody in the public space who was involved in unraveling the Stuxnet mystery.
0.4158224465598666 Which makes it possible to create a timeline of how Stuxnet was spreading.
0.445638771450795 While many of the Windows based vulnerabilities used by the worm have been fixed, other Stuxnet vulnerabilities "cannot be patched" he says , referring to problems that are inherent to the way SCADA and industrial control systems are designed and deployed.
0.1506259637990703 While members agreed the country poses a significant threat, Healey reminded them that U.S. government actions, including the unleashing of Stuxnet , likely has prompted attacks from that country, which may include DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions.
0.341260788147611 While modifying Stuxnet is obviously not easy, it is easier than creating the same functionality from scratch.
0.793050067696953 While most Stuxnet origin theories claim the malware to be written by Israel or US government, there are other theories as well.
0.480040691315546 While rumors of cyber-attacks were circulated about both, Flame was actually not a patch on the sophistication of Stuxnet in terms of malware authoring and in particular, the techniques used in the payload were not very impressive.
0.225053626538365 While Stuxnet is doing malicious modifications to the system, it uses a man-in-the-middle attack to fool the operators into thinking everything is normal.
0.2319550800855090 While Stuxnet was a very real thing and countries all over the world have increasingly impressive offensive capability and aren't shy about stating publicly that they are building further capability every day, there are also instances where its been shown that nation states aren't always to blame.
0.515775787336 While the AV companies all gave talks around the world dissecting the recent publicly discovered attacks like Stuxnet or Flame, most glossed over the simple fact that none of them discovered the virus till after it had done it's work.
0.567648984340385 While the intended target of Stuxnet appears to be the manipulation of Siemens PLCs, Weiss said Stuxnet could just have easy been designed to attack PLCs made by other SCADA manufacturers.
0.407399662489845 While there are some modifications, initial analysis indicates that this new driver is very similar to the first set of Stuxnet samples we've seen, with the same basic functions and approach.

0.401016428987837 With the advent of Stuxnet, Aurora, Wikileaks and the ensuing slew of DDoS attacks, and high profile government and private sector data breaches, it seems as though 2010 was the year that finally made cybersecurity an unavoidable topic, and perhaps proved that the US is reliant upon yet incapable of securing certain networks that make up our digital infrastructure.
0.3025890890023804 With the assistance of a Dutch researcher, the anti-virus company posits Stuxnet was penetrating SCADA networks for uranium since the worm was scouring drives at such a high frequency. .

0.312209895289385 India is also a center for botnets as bot infecting viruses like Ramnit and Sality are rampant. PC's in a botnet are used mainly by hackers for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), spamming and possibly bitcoin mining, he added.
0.625062492386638 There was a huge leap in the number of circulating viruses as well, and is attributed to basically two virus families: Xpiro and Sality, says Luis Corrons, the technical director for PandaLabs.
0.55834676649008 This increase is mainly down to two particular virus families: Sality and Xpiro. The first virus family has been around a long time, whereas the second one is more recent and capable of infecting executable files on 32-bit and 64-bit systems, says Luis Corrons, technical director of PandaLabs.

0.265363177837078 As revealed by a Kaspersky Lab report in August 2014, exploitation of the original CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability remained widespread even after the Microsoft patch in 2010, primarily because the exploit was integrated in more common threats like the Sality worm.
0.134309875638021 By using the HIPS runtime analysis feature of SAV as advised on the Sophos website the functionality of W32/Sality-AM will be significantly reduced and users will be better placed to diagnose any issues and submit files to SophosLabs for analysis.
0.731048294067753 However the bad guys really need to check their own computers, as the Trojan has itself been infected with the file-infecting virus W32/Sality-AM .
0.1391356116140135 I'd say it's unlikely this is a deliberate measure, as we've seen uninfected variants of this phishing Trojan in the past (which we detect as Mal/RarHosts-A ), and anyway the Sality doesn't so much hide the Trojan as paint it in bright colours, making it even easier to spot and to block.
0.295755285199276 It came in the form of BKDR_RILER.SVR , a backdoor that arrives infected by PE_SALITY.AC .
0.1990234489177258 It should also be noted that PE_SALITY.BA, like other previous SALITY variants, goes beyond merely infecting files.
0.278054426193972 Kilim at 11 percent and Sality at 10 percent rounded out the top three.
0.2993481305133147 Like other variants of the Sality family W32/Sality-AM includes code to inhibit the use of security software and to disable certain operating system tools to make the presence of the virus less obvious.
0.743409500749907 LNK attack vector, including a highly virulent strain named Sality.
0.325647475808544 Next-gen botnets such as the P2P variant of Zeus and Sality are much more resilient to sinkholing, injection attacks, and other disruptive means used against botnets in the past.
0.526860587352573 Not only is Sality a very large family, but it is known to infect other files (making full removal after infection challenging), copy itself to removable media, disable security, and then download other malware.
0.39940505650614 RILER and SALITY are definitely not new in the malware scene.
0.410494675682852 Sality and Zeus P2P proved to be the most resilient to analysis, the paper said.
0.375844197844286 Sality virus, Kido worm and the CVE-2010-2568 exploit are legacy attacks which were used to infect millions of machines worldwide, they are still widespread because they can easily infect new machines or they are publicly available for the criminals to use, which explains success rates if a device is not protected.

0.555515286602281 The Sality botnet, which was first discovered in 2003 and has been estimated to have hundreds of thousands or more infected machines in its zombie army, scanned IPv4 address space in February of last year via a covert scanning method that flew under the radar, according to new research from the University of California-San Diego and the University of Napoli in Italy.
0.2167321989001187 The Sality P2P botnet uses a peer reputation scheme which significantly complicates attacks.

0.763476896646921 A few days later, the malicious payload changed: an unnamed piece of ransomware that seems to be an evolution of CryptoLocker, but shows CTB-Locker-style instructions, Brad Duncan, a security researcher at Rackspace, noted .
0.75679161302813 A few minutes later, the desktop shows signs of infection by CTB-Locker:
0.507668903304802 A variant of Curve-Tor-Bitcoin (CTB) Locker ransomware - also known as Critroni - being distributed in a spam campaign now offers victims additional time to pay the ransom, but also requires them to pay a whole lot more than previously, according to the latest research by Trend Micro.
0.561350574434521 According to Richard Blech, CEO of Secure Channels , the resurgence of Critroni demonstrates that the design and implementation of security solutions on devices need to evolve to where they don't depend on the end user to protect their data to avoid a threat.
0.462344585531848 Active spam campaigns delivering fake notices about temporarily locked accounts have been spotted in the last few days delivering a deadly malware combination: the Dalexis downloader and the CTB-Locker (aka Critroni) ransomware.

0.697805973489472 In July 2014, versions of CTB-Locker were observed giving victims 72 hours to make a payment that was typically less than one Bitcoin.
0.591353211861445 In our previous entry, CTB-Locker Ransomware Includes Freemium Feature, Extends Deadline , we noted that the CTB-Locker variants included language support for four languages: English, German, Italian, and Dutch.
0.784602744864225 In that post, spam is also how CTB-Locker is being distributed, but victims are required to pay a ransom of 8 Bitcoins - or more than $1,800, as of Friday - within 96 hours.
0.798916819067512 In the past, the criminals used the popular Angler exploit kit in order to spread the CTB-Locker malware, this time the threat actor is spreading the ransomware through spam emails across several countries.
0.1734079995459150 It is very evident that the bad guys are constantly developing this type of malware family as seen in our previous posts about CryptoWall and CTB-Locker and Synolocker .
0.0626214727575117 Like CTB-Locker, CryptoWall doesn't take the traditional easy approach of using the legitimate Tor-executable obtained from the project's official website, but instead uses it's own obfuscated version of Tor.
0.3294533752737720 Malwarebytes detects it as Trojan.ZBAgent.NS - the signature they use for CTB Locker/Critroni ransomware.
0.704277913965237 Meanwhile, in the background, Dalexis also downloads the CTB-Locker, and the infection becomes obvious several minutes latet, when the ransomware finishes encrypting the victim's files and shows the ransom note.

0.2795760468050537 The compromised websites hosting CTB-Locker ransomware are also being used for PayPal phishing.
0.1834699727483891 The ransomware threat known as CTB-Locker (aka Critroni) is making fresh rounds, sneakily infiltrating people's machines via emails purporting to come from Google.
0.388548613603838 These threats include Cryptolocker, CryptoWall and CTB-Locker, which encrypt users' files with strong cryptographic algorithms, making it impossible to recover them in the absence of unaffected backups or without paying for the decryption keys.
0.4764397094998017 This malware connects to several URLs, leading to the download of the CTB-Locker malware onto the computer.
0.461488005854780 This new variant has a popup window that uses CTB-Locker-style instructions.
0.4590903931647616 Using the same URLs as those of the CTB-Locker malware suggests that the threat actors distributing the ransomware are also dabbling in phishing.
0.4888000115239653 We are here to warn you of the "Onion" ransomware (aka CTB-Locker), which uses anonymous TOR (The Onion Router) network and Bitcoins to better protect criminals, their funds and keys to victims' files from law enforcement.
0.433886445637234 We can see here that the malware just used an RTF file as a decoy, but has actually downloaded the CTB-Locker trojan into the user's system and executed it.
0.366001875509952 We soon came across an "improved" version of CTB-Locker Ransomware , which now offered a "free decryption" service, an extended deadline to decrypt the files, and an option to change the language of the ransom message.

0.705953148032319 According to CBL, some of these systems were running Gameover Zeus and Hesperbot malware.
0.713774551545525 After the takedowns of the Gameover Zeus and Shylock botnets, researchers predicted that a new breed of banking malware would fill the void.
0.204056014755354 Along with that advisory was a national press release from the US Department of Justice and the FBI that announced a multi-national effort against the GameOver Zeus botnet.
0.4204952867699359 Also, CryptoWall isn't as well connected as CryptoLocker, which had access to the GameOver ZeuS gang's cashout and laundering services.
0.549496216173603 Also, the report highlights Upatre , a loader previously used for delivering GOZ, which is now being used to deliver Dyreza.
0.4749971335575847 Although not as widespread as the Gameover malware knocked out by law enforcement in June 2014, Shylock had some of the same methods and the same motivation to crack into victims' bank accounts.
0.0809281744176567 Although ransomware that locks files until victims pay to restore them has existed for many years, it became more prevalent after the Gameover Zeus botnet operators introduced the once widespread but now-defunct CryptoLocker malware in early February 2015.
0.2134568077196763 And while the early leader, CryptoLocker, was taken down (along with the "Gameover ZeuS" botnet) last June , other improved "ransomware" packages have sprung up to fill its niche-including the sound-alike CryptoWall.
0.0823203509775206 And yesterday, the answer to our query was this: Gameover ZeuS has some additional strings.

0.1802509917401111 But according to Peter Kruse, a security specialist at CSIS Security Group, Gameover's user base has recently been launching attacks against customers of financial services firms and other organizations for the first time.
0.3154805893993 But because GameOver utilizes a P2P network of infected hosts to communicate and distribute data, and employs encryption to evade detection, it doesn't have a single point of failure\u2026and makes takedown efforts more difficult.".

0.720770363453158 First of all, let's take a look at why we think this a new Gameover variant and not malware from some other family.
0.0416438570817023 For an example, let's take a look at the takedown of "Gameover" ZeuS , code name "Operation Tovar."

0.4281473728591953 Gameover is just one of many bots and botnets that are currently at large on the internet.
0.273022568177648 Gameover is particularly troubling, according to the CTU , not only because of its peer-to-peer design, which makes taking it down nearly impossible, but also because it is privately operated, meaning, you can't really buy variants of it on criminal hacking forums, making it harder for researchers to track down and reverse engineer.

0.591021343516982 Here's an overview of some of last week's most interesting news, interviews, podcasts and articles: International action against Gameover Zeus botnet and CyptoLocker ransomware On Friday, 30 May...
0.312115944704560 However, this week has seen one positive proactive move by law enforcers, when the FBI, UK National Crime Agency and Europol joined forces to disrupt the GameOver Zeus botnet and CryptoLocker .
0.720663496305060 If you are using a browser which GameOver doesn't support ( Lynx anyone? , or a native 64-bit browser), it may be that your computer is infected, but the browser has no traces of the malware.
0.531824830426294 If you launch the file, it downloads an unstructured lump of data - known to programmers as a BLOB, short for "binary large object" - which is actually an obfuscated and compressed copy of the Gameover malware:
0.368580227622314 If you suspect to be infected, Symantec has released a new tool to allow removal of Gameover Zeus infection from the victim's machine, data provided by the security company confirms that US and Italy are the counties most affected by the botnet.
0.559017231524464 In addition to the efforts to disrupt the Gameover ZeuS botnet, the DOJ led a separate effort to disrupt Cryptolocker, by "identifying and seizing computer servers acting as command and control hubs for the Cryptolocker malware.".
0.46069045592613 In early June 2014, international law enforcement agencies combined to carry out a hugely successful action called Operation Tovar against the cybercrime group behind the malware family known variously as Gameover , Gameover Zeus or GOZ .
0.3819633586832489 In fact, the crooks can do pretty much anything they like, not least because Gameover, like most zombie malware, includes a general-purpose "download, install and launch yet more malware" function.
0.0970009187777581 In June 2014, the U.S. Justice Department joined authorities in many other countries and a large number of security firms in taking down the Gameover ZeuS botnet , which at the time was estimated to have infected more than a million PCs.
0.62705112051102 In March, Dell SecureWorkds named Shylock one of the Top Banking Botnets of 2013, citing that it was responsible for 7% of the banking malware it detected (behind only GameOver ZeuS, Citadel, and other variants of ZeuS).
0.2994543511107806 In one spam campaign, fraudsters tricked users into installing Gameover by sending spurious emails designed to look like browser updates from Microsoft.
0.21827525538739 In other words, finding out you've had Gameover for the past month is like realising you forgot to hang up the phone and your boss has been listening in to the last 30 minutes of garrulous tittle-tattle you've been having with your chums.
0.433502398173314 In our 1H 2014 post, we wrote that the number of spam campaigns related to UPATRE went down in June due to the Gameover takedown that same month.
0.1051929749915254 In some cases, crooks conducting cyberheists against businesses have been launching DDoS assaults against the victim's bank - as in the case of account takeovers involving the Gameover Trojan .
0.0885885290601432 In the case of Gameover, that purpose was to distribute the Zeus trojan, which in turn would perform a wire fraud scheme that involves stealing financial credentials from infected users' computers and then sending money from the victims' accounts to those controlled by the attackers.
0.0500836926301174 In the event the infected Gameover systems can't get new instructions from their peers, the code instructs the botted systems to seek out domains from the latest list of 1,000 domains generated by the DGA until it finds a site with new instructions.
0.690744356592584 In the over 250,000 samples F-Secure Labs processes a day, our analysts have seen similar Affiliate models used with the largest banking trojans and GameOver ZeuS, which he notes are also coming from Russia.
0.153390062110044 In the same way that we casually use the word virus these days to talk about malware in general, rather than just the special sort of malware that spreads by itself, so we talk about Zeus and Gameover to mean a whole raft of malware produced as part of extensive cybercrime operations.

0.735261220814453 The first Gameover Zeus resurgence warnings began July 10, when security experts spotted an apparent variant of the malware that was being distributed in a spam e-mail campaign (see Gameover Zeus Trojan Returns ).
0.446368186401492 The Gameover takedown has also spawned at least three distinct new botnets.

0.3091550363110263 The headlines in 2014 were filled with news about "takedowns," which are collaborative efforts typically between the private sector, governments and academia designed to shut down a cyber crime operation, such as a botnet (like GameOver ZeuS ) or banking trojan (like Shylock).
0.0579385265824834 The Internet Service Providers involved in the action against GOZeuS and Cryptolocker are able to take advantage of the intelligence behind the law enforcement operation to identify which of their customers are infected, to notify them and assist them with clean-up.

0.3262842847815563 The new GameOver Zeus no longer utilizes the P2P protocol but but generates a series of domain with a DGA algorithm , this makes easy for bad actors to quickly rebuilding their malicious infrastructure even more law enforcement take down it.
0.762456138239887 The operation against Gameover and CryptoLocker by law enforcement is most welcome, and should be applauded .
0.580636584889109 The operation was a success, shutting down activity from the Gameover botnet for the past month.
0.1593393068819238 The takedown of Gameover Zeus may raise the stakes in the arms race between criminals and law enforcement, according to Sullivan.

0.638589904230739 "Then you click the link and bang! It's GameOver Zeus, or Cryptolocker," Peterson said referring to two nasty Trojans that are spread using email."We're seeing the weaponisation of malware in the email channel. In the last three months they've really hit their stride,"
0.511780734640389 There is always the chance that the botnet will spring back to life -- much as the Zeus botnet had done after the collapse of Gameover.
0.3043432554418449 There was good news in the quarter, however, with the FBI and the UK's NCA temporarily disrupting the infamous Gameover Zeus botnet, allowing users to remediate their machines and install more effective security software.
0.1242542111864224 There's good news following this week's global law enforcement takedown of the Zeus Gameover Trojan and Cryptolocker ransomware campaigns: The number of new infections has become "very low," if not fallen to zero.

0.746465836176309 This May, the GameOver Zeus botnet made history by becoming one of the largest botnets ever seized by law enforcement.
0.454320951284976 This model is quite similar to that of GOZeuS, and quite unlike malware like BlackShades, which is sold on the black market to anyone for about $40 a pop.
0.1813115426645458 This particular strain of Gameover is taking a fresh approach.
0.572531514362690 This takedown operation continues a trend that began in June with Operation Tovar , the effort to take down the Gameover ZeuS botnet -- an international, public-private collaboration principally aimed at disrupting the crimes, instead of arresting the criminals.
0.318941605634065 Though other P2P botnets such as Kelihos exist, Gameover is notable for its use of proxy nodes to introduce complexity into the standard P2P infrastructure.
0.448858913124312 Today's column features an interview with two security experts who helped plan and execute last week's global, collaborative effort to hijack the Gameover Zeus botnet , an extremely resilient and sophisticated crime machine that helped an elite group of thieves steal more than $100 million from banks, businesses and consumers worldwide.
0.593422445867641 Turns out, we can use this to "trick" GameOver bots and make an easy check to see if an infection is present in your browser!
0.3651276535883022 Two U.S. government agencies are offering a US$3 million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of a Russian man suspected of having served as an administrator for the destructive Gameover Zeus botnet.
0.3881388147508094 Typical Gameover spams include an attachment pretending to be an account statement, with a message body like this:
0.3735634033426382 Unlike many Zeus operators, however, the gang behind Gameover doesn't sell their version of the code directly, but instead allows customers to lease the botnet for their attacks.
0.7595990291448 Unlike Team Fortress 2 or Doom, two of the most popular PC games of all time, GameOver ZeuS is not a game you can buy online or would willingly download on to your computer.
0.711638348992535 U.S. authorities also filed charges this week against Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev (a.k.a. Slavik), a Russian citizen who they say is the mastermind behind the Cryptolocker and Gameover gang, which has stolen more than $130 million.
0.601209043680964 U.S. law enforcement agencies have obtained civil and criminal court orders in Pittsburgh authorizing them to sinkhole Gameover Zeus traffic, with this technique the security experts can profile the botnet, evaluate its extension and interrupt communication between compromised machines and the C&C servers.
0.502954509256401 We anticipate the criminal infrastructure of both Gameover Zeus and CryptoLocker will re-establish operations as quickly as they can.
0.589083074057547 We do not know if it is being operated by the same people that were indicted last month, or a subset of them, or indeed a different group altogether that has obtained the Gameover source code.
0.754515501537004 We have found only 23 domains related to this specific variant of Gameover.
0.3502712490174566 We recently wrote about an international takedown operation , spearheaded by US law enforcement, against the Gameover and CryptoLocker malware.
0.648574434857127 Week in review: Defeating UEFI's SecureBoot, Gameover Zeus botnet disrupted, first Android file-encrypting Trojan.
0.288383283380348 What constitutes winning in the fight against malware, and what's the value of a takedown ask commentators in the wake of Gameover Zeus' bounceback.
0.542540908049782 When an international law enforcement action earlier this month knocked out the Gameover botnet , one happy consequence was the takedown of the servers that the CryptoLocker ransomware needed in order to do its dirty work.
0.743953486592650 When it comes to financial crime, malware disruptions in 2014 changed the threat landscape by eliminating two prevalent malware families: the June takeover of Gameover Zeus (GOZ), which sent shockwaves through the criminal underworld, and a takedown of Shylock in July.
0.2216956207440359 When it launches, Gameover installs into your Application Data directory, tagging itself with a short block of system-specific binary data.
0.55483611588073 "Whether that's because they're using the old infrastructure or it's just a rise in the new variants, we're not sure," says Morten Kjaersgaard, CEO of the company, which has been tracking the success of the Gameover Zeus takedown operation.
0.4852822459043397 Why it is increasing is not clear but it could be that criminals have turned to it as other forms of previously successful ransom malware, for instance CryptoLocker, have been destroyed (Damballa being among the firms that helped with the downing of its distribution platform, Gozeus, during Operation Tovar).
0.505682179574592 With co-operation from the Ukrainian authorities, seized and copied key Gameover command servers in Kiev and Donetsk.
0.440227462720351 "Without arresting Bogachev, Gameover ZeuS is still a huge threat and likely to evolve to become more dangerous.
0.436573560066079 You can see why CryptoLocker captured the imagination more than Gameover: CryptoLocker is one of those in-your-face, "so near but so far" threats.
0.352801386972827 Zeus Gameover, which was discovered in September 2011, is based on the Zeus financial malware source code, which began circulating on underground hacking forums earlier that year.

0.538804768523440 In September 2014 after the Neutrino exploit kit (EK) had disappeared for 6 months, it reappeared in a different form.
0.54779998739043 It wasn't until March 2015 that we observed Neutrino Flash pack attacks on the computers of 60,541 users.
0.1066492636472163 Lately, we have seen a number of communications through our automated framework from the Neutrino botnet.
0.1071466160845038 Looking at this data, the Neutrino, Glazunov and Sibhost exploit kits are currently dominant.
0.752276030183642 Neutrino has a simple control panel and includes features that evade antivirus and IPS systems when exploited successfully.
0.2936148524163225 Neutrino was first reported in March 2013 by Kafeine on his Malware Don't need Coffee blog [2].

It's clear the cybercriminals know there is a Java update problem for many organizations," Matthew Mors of Websense wrote in an analysis of the trend."Forty percent of Java 6 users are vulnerable to these new exploits and there are no software patches in sight. Effective exploit kit delivery mechanisms, such as Neutrino, and unpatched vulnerabilities targeting Java 6 create a significant challenge for organizations that have not updated to Java 7."
0.0626154536392007 No user interaction is required to launch the Flash exploit, which ultimately drops various malware payloads through an exploit kit similar to Neutrino .

0.1795632094322523 Security experts at TrendLabs remarked that this quarter Neutrino Exploit Kit included a Java 6 vulnerability, a version no more supported by Oracle, the company also announced that around 31 recently disclosed vulnerabilities will never be patched triggering the interest of cybercrime community.
0.3819111569828752 Shown above: Neutrino EK sends the malware payload.
0.325551916989339 Since 2005, when Mpack was first released, over 100 individually marketed exploit packs -- with names like Black Hole, Neutrino, and Sweet Orange -- have been sold to leverage the World Wide Web and to exploit victims' computers.
0.3829581015154811 Some of the computers were also redirected to domains hosting other exploit kits such as Neutrino and Magnitude in order to server further malicious code.
0.282486845322439 Some of the infected computers then appear to have been directed to websites hosting other exploit kits such as Neutrino and Magnitude, loading yet more malware.

0.0985296230954666 The methods in Neutrino are quite similar to others; however, the highlighted features in Neutrino mean that attackers are indeed becoming more sophisticated and organized.
0.501506533189485 The Neutrino exploit kit took more of a whitehat path to obfuscation and fetches the code, in parts, using AJAX .
0.457937263517086 The researchers suspect that the exploit kit served by the cyber criminals could be the Neutrino kit or the Sweet Orange kit .
0.2441944162411707 The (Russian) Neutrino exploit kit was first described by the French researcher Kafeine (Malware don't need Coffee) almost exactly one year ago.
0.2327688864021345 However, Seculert's Research Lab believed that this conclusion was incorrect, and upon further analysis discovered the culprit was not ZxShell, but instead a totally different malware that functioned as a backdoor, downloader, and information stealer.
0.676572637434508 If ZxShell successfully connects to the remote host, the function DoHandshake is called.
0.545806904569915 Initially, the malware used in the attack was reported to be ZxShell (aka Sensocode), a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
0.0759300748954460 The malicious JavaScript code loads a Flash object that in turn infects the victim with a payload that downloads a backdoor ZxShell Trojan.

0.51865173855509 VOBFUS.JDN is a dangerous computer infection which belongs to the Vobfus family.
0.4048129657732244 According to security firm Trend Micro, worms in the Vobfus family function as "downloaders of other malware," which can be leveraged by attackers to remotely steal data on compromised machines.
0.2053711214058693 And to make matters even thornier for network security professionals, Win32/Beebone and Vobfus also install an auto-run file on any disk or drive they infect, including USB flash drives.
0.609767146622935 Beebone would then initiate and download Vobfus in addition to other threats, which in turn would do the same.
0.2723278833331014 Microsoft has documented a curious infection cycle between the Vobfus worm and the Beebone Trojan , where Vobfus variants will download Beebone variants, which in turn download Vobfus variants, and so on.
0.181932793475020 Microsoft's Malware Protection Center observed an infection cycle in the wild where Vobfus variants download Beebone variants that in turn download more Vobfus malware that then went and downloaded other strains of Beebone that did same thing, presumably until someone stepped in and stopped prevented it from doing so.
0.537661386951562 The post Win32/Beebone and Vobfus Working Together to Avoid Antivirus Products & Evade Removal appeared first on Seculert Blog on Advanced Persistent Threats and Malware .

0.433094458845459 A Swedish man pleaded guilty Wednesday to peddling one of the most prevalent spying programs called Blackshades that was widely used by the criminal underground.
0.474170379595129 About 700,000 PCs worldwide are estimated to have been infected with the malware and the NCA claims that about 200,000 usernames and passwords for various online services have been extracted using Blackshades from users in the UK alone.
0.770483559720329 According to court documents, the Blackshades RAT was bought by at least several thousand users (law enforcement officials found roughly 6,000 customer profiles) in more than 100 countries and was used to infect more than half a million computers worldwide.
0.3975799524363423 According to officials who spoke to Time Magazine , law enforcement agencies swooped on Blackshades users in Europe, Asia and the US.
0.701087751731861 Alex Yucel, 24, the alleged co-author of the Blackshades remote access Trojan (RAT) and owner-operator of the BlackShades organization, pleaded not guilty Thursday to multiple cybercrime charges levied against him last week as part of a major FBI sting that netted more than 90 other arrests.

0.442961705971137 Although in recent years a license to Blackshades sold for several hundred Euros, early versions of the product were sold via PayPal for just USD $40.
0.659577433097046 Although inexpensive, the Blackshades RAT has an extensive set of capabilities such as keystroke logger, web cam control, full file access, etc. More than enough for the cyber attacker to assume the full identity of the owner of the compromised computer to allow them easy access to the business critical servers inside the data center as depicted in the diagram.
0.1745431578228334 Among those arrested in the CarderProfit sting was Michael Hogue , the alleged co-creator of Blackshades.

0.05730148187273320 As far as Blackshades being done with, it's possible that a lack of interest due to the high profile of this malware might drive away a large portion of the market, in which case Blackshades won't be updated and it's functionality will become obsolete.
0.575947503115072 As the FBI reported in the criminal complaint , the nastyware that turned up in the search of his computers and the analysis of his electronic slime trail included evidence of keylogging, plus messages relating to the use of two remote-access tools (RATs) or Trojans - Blackshades and Darkcomet - which can be used to control victims' computers, including turning on a computer's camera.

0.336602929163323 Blackshades, which can be used for legitimate purposes such as accessing a work machine from home, is better known for the shady things that hackers have used it for including keystroke logging and the taking over of webcams.
0.558407539867066 Competitively priced, with a rich feature list, Blackshades provides the attacker with complete control over an infected machine.
0.606371546970880 Early on in its development, researchers at CitzenLab discovered that Blackshades was being used to spy on activists seeking to overthrow the regime in Syria .
0.1283603138960037 Even law enforcement knows Blackshades wasn't a huge menace, outside of its occasional usage to spy on people via webcams and extortion attempts.
0.5189250868563 Fortunately, the interest in Blackshades has decreased due to an array of different issues with the product.
0.353254410056145 He added that the multi-pronged, international law enforcement effort to target Blackshades users could be an effective strategy.
0.1958902403107152 In March, Jared Abrahams, a 20-year-old computer science major, was arrested and accused of using Blackshades to blackmail Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf (a former classmate of his) and at least eight other women.
0.518786016505063 It seemed that the people running BlackShades forgot that they were running an illegal operation.
0.1590699341624162 Johnston was a paid employee of the Blackshades organization who conducted marketing and sales and managed a customer tech support team, officials say.
0.4755763911713465 Law enforcement agencies in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia have been praised after they worked together to arrest almost 100 hackers - including 17 from the UK - allegedly associated with the Blackshades Remote Access Trojan.
0.659088861682000 Monitoring and escalation is key to detecting and minimizing the impact that Blackshades might have on your environment.
0.377971640772741 On Friday, we reported about the large-scale operation of International raids launched by the FBI and other law enforcement officials in countries around the world to arrest the targeted customers of a popular Remote Administration Tool (RAT) called 'Blackshades,' which is designed to take over the remote control of the infected computers and steal information.
0.789423376249740 One factor behind cybercrime's growth was briefly exposed in the recent Blackshades arrests of nearly 100 people who had purchased malware tools "as-a-service," and, allegedly with minimal technical skills, attacked and commandeered the systems of countless victims.
0.2555013698639375 One famous case of Blackshades use was that of Jared James Abrahams, 20, the sextortionist who preyed on around 150 women including Miss Teen USA, Cassidy Wolf .
0.541250339767862 One proof point on how effective this innovation engine has become, we need to remember that one of the original authors of Blackshades was arrested in 2012 and yet Blackshades continues to be developed by the community.
0.1119550669569772 Rappa was also a Blackshades customer who used it to operate victims' webcams and steal their personal data, court documents allege.
0.040507352447307 Several thousand people bought Blackshades, and investigators said it may have infected more than 500,000 computers worldwide.
0.2902037424604838 Symantec revealed in November last year that hundreds of C&C servers were being used to gather credentials from computers as part of a resurgent Blackshades campaign, despite one of the authors of the malware having been arrested in 2012.
0.1789259603682872 Taking off the Blackshades (Cyber-crime) Malware Threat Intelligence Lead Adam Kujawa took on Blackshades , the potential danger one may encounter who are willing to use RATs for their own personal advantage, the troubles of having such a Trojan installed on a system, and the prediction that RATs will continue to become a threat.
0.290938955224554 The arrests follow an FBI-led operation in May that resulted in the arrests of 100 alleged Blackshades RAT users across more than a dozen countries.
0.4634349667967253 The Blackshades malware reflects this growing sophistication.
0.1851134460101643 The co-creator of the $40 Blackshades Remote Access Tool (RAT) pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal charge of distributing malware that federal authorities said infected half a million computers globally.
0.599756907396697 The FBI led the charge against users of the malware, who purchased Blackshades from an underground marketplace known as "bshades.eu", according to the Wall Street Journal .
0.629619823698763 The scale of the arrests-rarely have so many cybercriminals been arrested in one go-is entirely due to Blackshades' ease of use.
0.764343385383227 The US government seized more than 1,900 domain names used by Blackshades customers to control infected computers.
0.0644250247122152 They are also usually sold for far more than the malware itself, in fact Blackshades had a built-in crypter marketplace that it included in it's control panel, to make it easy for the bad guys to find a crypter and apply it to their malware.
0.733734666908543 This means that if an old version of Blackshades was encrypted with a modern crypter tool, it could potentially bypass an antivirus scan and even email filters that check for malware (Thanks Gmail!).
0.406680785146057 Those using Blackshades were targeted in a massive law enforcement effort in May 2014 involving 16 countries.
0.609370268976941 Trend Micro protects users from this threat by detecting the created RATs, as well as blocking the main site that sold Blackshades.
0.3470614104949233 TrendMicro researchers say that another problem BlackShades brought upon itself was that, because of its very accessible, user-friendly nature, it appealed to amateur ne'er-do-wells, enabled "entry-level cybercrime," and left itself more exposed to risk.
0.405161850558480 While the Blackshades' product and services were exemplary, Yucel's failings in finance and risk management might be his undoing.

0.765866634997783 The experts explained that CoolReaper is the first malware they have seen that was built and operated by an Android manufacturer.
0.2004618820795158 The impact could be really serious, more than 10 million users worldwide are menaced by the presence of the CoolReaper on the mobile devices.
0.565575689272115 Another interesting twist, according to Trend's research, is that the bad guys behind the Predator Pain and Limitless malware still retain administrative rights to the malware when they sell a copy; they get access to the victims that the buyers infect, as well.

0.760823824783691 Cybercriminals used a mix of social engineering and the Carbanak family of malware to infiltrate banks around the world and steal as much a $1 billion since 2013, according to a recent Kaspersky Labs report .
0.22824767742565 Experts at Kaspersky that discovered the Carbanak cybergang described the campaign as probably the "most sophisticated attack the world has seen", due to its very low profile and high impact.
0.255856769556233 Fake domain names such as update-java.net and adobe-update.net, for example, were used in the recently discovered "Carbanak" attacks on banks that allowed criminals to gain access to financial institutions' networks starting in January 2013 and steal over $1 billion over the next two years.
0.235809210129215 For the Carbanak kind of exposure, no bank is going to want to broadcast that it has been successfully hacked, making timely notification problematic.

0.387392795288431 Revealed for the first time last month, the Carbanak campaign targeted around 100 banks worldwide.
0.505687968610328 Sergey Golovanov, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, who worked on the Carbanak research, says one victim bank his team assisted said all of its branches in that country had been hit, and another bank admitted it had been attacked multiple times by the gang.
0.665633553389760 "That's when we started looking in the bank's infrastructure, and that's actually how we found Carbanak," he says.
0.618568805642920 The attacks are said to begin with a classic spear phishing email sent to a bank employee, infecting them with the Carbanak malware.
0.0782539418666711 The Carbanak APT group which has stolen millions of pounds from global banks may have close ties to Russia after all.
0.595298163108787 The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network).

0.64556772009912 However, after our investigations we discovered that the ISFB debug string is indeed rather the private name for Rovnix.".
0.509735497784165 Last year we saw how the Windows PowerShell® command shell was involved in spreading ROVNIX via malicious macro downloaders .
0.327524192250337 My colleagues in ESET's Russian labs have been tracking the Rovnix bootkit family (siblings included) since spring 2011, and a fascinating evolution it's been, too, taking in a series of techniques for bypassing the security measures built into 64-bit (x64) Windows.
0.378634009235060 Peter Kruse of CSIS said that the Rovnix creators have made changes to help evade detection by various security products.
0.699811293406366 Rovnix implements a DGA, which fits the description from the US Constitution on malware generating domains.
0.47733526426687 Rovnix is a malware variant that often has been distributed by other kinds of malware.
0.3606753015044076 ROVNIX poses dangers to both users and enterprises since aside from its backdoor capabilities, it can steal passwords and record keystrokes.
0.494304803559423 The newer version of Rovnix, analyzed by researchers at CSIS in Denmark, has some differences from the older variants.
0.510744571949094 This is similar to Rovnix which used words from the U.S. Constitution to create its domains.
0.393884883770440 We recently found that the malware family ROVNIX is capable of being distributed via macro downloader .
0.257240130624579 Well, it fascinates those of us who work in that area of malware research, who will already have hotfooted over to the ESET blog to read Aleksandr Matrosov's blog article for the technical lowdown on the latest modifications to the Rovnix bootkit framework.
0.4257417638402959 Anyway the analysis of the various samples allowed the researchers at F-Secure to discover the link with the MiniDuke gang, the owner of the Command & Control (C&C) server used to manage the a sample of the OnionDuke malware spread through the malicious exit node, W32/OnionDuke.A, is the same that was involved of MiniDuke agent.
0.0908596150952052 "Based on compilation timestamps and discovery dates of samples we have observed, we believe the OnionDuke operators have been infecting downloaded executables at least since the end of October 2013.
0.630996241832483 Experts at F-Secure discovered a link between the crew operating the rogue Tor node that was used to spread the OnionDuke malware and the MiniDuke APT.
0.730200416782537 F-Secure added that there's strong evidence to suggest OnionDuke itself has been used in targeted attacks against European government agencies, although the infection vector remains a mystery.
0.347100594938037 F-Secure has christened this new malware family OnionDuke and revealed that the cyber-criminals behind it have been infecting and downloading executables at least since the end of October 2013.
0.1178121290953615 "OnionDuke," as the malware spread through the latest attacks is known, is a completely different malware family, but some of the command and control (C&C) channels it uses to funnel commands and stolen data to and from infected machines were registered by the same persona that obtained MiniDuke C&Cs.
0.786643995687383 Researchers at F-Secure firm are constantly monitoring the cyber espionage campaigns MiniDuke , CosmicDuke and OnionDuke and provided an interesting update on the hacking operation.
0.239210858490661 The experts also noticed that in the mass infection campaigns, the C&C infrastructure was relying on compromised servers and free hosting services, and in these cases, the attackers have used a lighter version of OnionDuke.
0.152871277235183 The researchers at F-Secure revealed that in APT campaigns, the attackers used a dedicates infrastructure for OnionDuke that's shared with MiniDuke.
0.4064532023869771 Tor officials have long counseled people to employ a VPN when using the privacy service, and OnionDuke provides a strong cautionary tale when users fail to heed that advice.
0.0454210239697505 03 September 2013 A variant of the Citadel online banking trojan is targeting users in Japan, with the campaign itself ongoing since early June of this year.
0.760546015535707 A Citadel domain appeared yesterday on the Zeus tracker:
0.521054024805555 A customer who bought a license to the Citadel Trojan extended an invitation to drop in on that community of hackers.
0.2188826168687786 A key Citadel developer has been banned from one of the largest online groups that sells the banking trojan \u2013 another sign that Citadel perpetrators are steadily withdrawing from the commercial market to privatize their operations, researchers said this week.
0.75954009330631 A miscreant who operates a Citadel botnet of respectable size (a few thousand bots, e.g.) can expect to quickly accumulate huge volumes of "logs," records of user credentials and browsing history from victim PCs.
0.59470318252028 A new variant of Citadel malware is making the rounds that is targeting Payza, a money transfer service popular all over the world, especially in developing nations that are under-serviced when it comes to accessing the Internet.
0.0483639394335070 A new variant of the Citadel banking Trojan has been discovered where the attackers are using Windows remote shell commands to be enable Remote Desktop Protocol access, even if the malware is discovered and removed.
0.565863583589069 A password malware variant of the Citadel Trojan that recently came on the scene looks to have the functionality to capture passwords from password managers.
0.47529105350168 A screenshot of the Citadel botnet panel.
0.603447712882577 A team of attackers with a penchant for Shakespearian verse has used the popular cyber-crime program known as Citadel to infiltrate government offices in Poland and Japan as well as a number of companies in Denmark and Sweden, according to a report published by security firm McAfee.
0.311824656213666 According to IBM Trusteer researchers, the newest Citadel variants have been instructed to start capturing user keystrokes when the user starts open-source password management solutions Password Safe or KeePass, or the neXus Personal Security Client, an authentication solution for securely effecting financial or e-commerce transactions.
0.789717747962197 According to the security researchers, Citadel is "highly evasive and can bypass threat detection systems .
0.62206437808718 Additionally they announced that David Raphael, who has worked with Carl and Billy at Citadel and McAfee has joined the team as Director of engineering.
0.351015100660502 Alperovitch said the hackers behind this Citadel version may be trying to map out who exactly the victims are - as a precursor to selling access to those machines.
0.195050067412155 And this is how the protection of Citadel become super weak and can generate working malwares.
0.2221198228098859 And you can't just 'force' the procedure to generate a bot because the Citadel stub is encrypted inside, that why when the package got leaked with the correct HID, a easy way to crack the builder appeared.
0.615084376714411 Another indication that Citadel is being used for purposes other than financial fraud is that some campaigns involving government targets lack a malware configuration file containing banking targets.
0.523923577508087 Another interesting feature is that seems that Russian users cannot get infected by KINS exactly like happened to the Citadel.
0.466895454679232 Another really famous kind of financial malware is called Citadel and it is used in order to be able to collect any kind of information consider to be important apart from financial clues.
0.306067830007864 As evidence that malware is using old-school techniques to overcome security solutions, a recent variant of the Citadel banking Trojan demonstrates how attackers, who are likely using Citadel to target enterprises, are using a simple yet effective trick to maintain persistency.
0.469535112216689 "As Reuters first reported," continued Boskovitch, "due to Citadel's size and complexity, we do not expect to fully take out all of the botnets in the world using the Citadel malware.
0.562713345316494 As with most banking Trojans, Citadel is a full crimeware kit, providing the attackers with payload builders, a command and control (C&C) server infrastructure, and configuration scripts to target various banks.
0.50695565913347 At the same time, Citadel offers the attacker the ability to run Windows shell commands.
0.444196071439741 "Attackers launched the Citadel trojan, typically reserved for financial theft, to beat two-factor authentication and hack into the virtual private network (VPN) of a major international airport.
0.0603819261137243 But if history is any guide, this doesn't mean the banking trojan Citadel is extinguished for good.
0.686119811619022 But, more than that, the group or groups behind Citadel have developed a community of customers and contributors around the malware that is suggesting new features, contributing code and modules.
0.512517020348470 But, some of those domains turned out to be sinkholes that malware researchers had set up previously in order to track Citadel's operations.
0.4354748833461895 But this version of Citadel sought much more information, and instructed all infected PCs to relay the output of several network diagnostic tools designed to help map out a local network.

0.334330803688692 The banking Trojan known as Citadel, which debuted in underground forums in January 2012, has evolved to become one of the financial industry's greatest worries, cybersecurity experts say.
0.1639259371298131 The basic Citadel package - a bot builder and botnet administration panel - retails for $2,399 + a $125 monthly "rent," but some of its most innovative features are sold as a la carte add-ons.
0.0981256998991596 The Citadel crimeware toolkit, originally designed to steal sensitive information from infected Windows PCs, has been upgraded to grab the master passwords used to unlock password management applications, according to IBM's Trusteer security division.

0.1719111034386703 The Citadel trojan, a popular program used by cybercriminals to gather banking credentials and steal money from accounts, has become the latest financial malware to be repurposed as a tool to steal industrial secrets-this time from petrochemical companies in the Middle East.
0.416490931886108 The Citadel Trojan is a malware designed to steal personal information, including banking and financial data, from infected machines.
0.1200465803077055 The Citadel trojan is another example of how incisive and targeted malware can be, attacking individual organizations, while also harvesting credentials and passwords from users.
0.1526469869206211 The Citadel Trojan is capable of bypassing most threat detection security systems and laying low until it is instructed spring into action.
0.391384676035485 The Citadel Trojan is currently most prevalent in European countries, and the number of infections is rather small - around 1,000.
0.3909473282689993 The Citadel Trojan is really starting to become kind of a pain in the neck.
0.429120541723775 The company's researchers identified Citadel as the malware used to infect and steal data from the companies, which included "one of the largest sellers of petrochemical products in the Middle East and a regional supplier of raw petrochemical materials," the analysis stated.
0.3374356365497165 The crew behind the Citadel malware recently announced that it would no longer be selling it publicly and would only conduct private sales.
0.772187116880710 The developer, \u201cAquabox,\u201d was banned from an online forum after a Citadel buyer accused him of \u201cbecoming corrupt by all the money Citadel was earning him,\u201d according to a Tuesday blog post from RSA.
0.3237083105306761 "The fact that they used Citadel when it's obsolete tells me either they don't know what they are doing" or the attackers aren't very experienced, he says.
0.331691479044029 The Federal Bureau of Investigation's new warning about Citadel malware attacks has the industry's attention, and for good reason.
0.339800575864842 The level of adoption and development of Citadel is rapidly growing, and since then Seculert has identified over 20 different Citadel botnets (See figures 1 and 2 for statistics), using the following different versions of the malware:
0.621709632939515 "The machine was already infected by Citadel when IBM Trusteer Apex was installed on it.
0.335401105850622 "The most recently discovered Citadel variants have built-in DNS redirect functionality that prevents infected systems from contacting the websites of major IT security vendors and global law enforcement agencies," the report said.
0.0734281275608181 The outfit runs the Citadel Botnets and is believed to have stolen more than $500 million from bank accounts over the past 18 months.
0.319629287803451 The research found that a configuration file, which attackers use to tailor the Citadel trojan for specific campaigns, had been modified to start up a keylogger when the user opened either Password Safe or KeePass, two open-source password managers.
0.2033405252535055 The researchers went on to say that the same attacks-which exploit weaknesses in the way Microsoft code processes TIFF images-is being waged by yet another group, alternately dubbed Arx and Ark, to deliver the Citadel trojan.
0.229290133581307 The rumors were soon hushed and ties to Citadel were denied, mostly in what appeared as a case of fearful fraudsters who did not want to be denied the possibility to buy the next Trojan."
0.4587573048879236 The same thing happened to other security researchers, and the Abuse.ch researcher estimated that 25 percent of the Citadel domains seized in the operation were legitimate sinkholes operated by researchers.
0.05396350093719548 The security team at Trusteer, an IBM company, has just discovered a Citadel variant that takes this approach a step further, providing enhanced survivability for the attack as well as expanding this malware's capabilities to perpetrate targeted attacks on enterprises."
0.782842750353130 The string of espionage campaigns marks a significant departure for the group of developers behind the Citadel Trojan.
0.613087128308129 Then on Aug. 17, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center issued a public alert about a Citadel attack launched with ransomware feigning to be from the FBI.
0.641296633310322 Then there is the Citadel Trojan, which was dangerous in its own unique way, using an open-source development model that let anyone review its code and improve upon it.
0.315823585024981 There are several improvements that make Citadel stand out, and give credence to the authors' attempts to make Citadel the crimeware kit of choice for cybercrooks:
0.410933000204950 "There is significant amount of recent activity, as late as Jan. 13, to suggest that private customers will continue to use Citadel to attack business and government organizations.".
0.1102309580335698 These are not your average hackers; they didn't just buy a version of the Citadel malware.
0.603441400871275 These botnet logs were from the Citadel botnet Version 1.3.4.5 (Extreme Edition).
0.1655203068196592 "They disrupted more than 1,000 botnets operated by Citadel, but it's important that people understand that while the operation was important, it didn't solve the problem," Maor said. "They disrupted botnets that were up and running, but anyone who has the Citadel builder can build a new variant and distribute it. They didn't eliminate Citadel. Yeah, business took a hit, but it can be recreated."
0.4937565723006671 This case helps us see that Citadel is being used for interests other than financial crime."
0.2254137354376620 This configuration file shows how flexible and powerful the Citadel platform is.
0.0881915051873459 This in turn led to a general belief that Citadel would decline in use.
0.633954446080736 This overall process has remained the same through Citadel revisions, but the specifics of the encryption algorithms have changed.
0.654953704301899 This particular Citadel variant also included a form-grabber, or HTTP POST grabber-which steals user input from a form before it's encrypted via SSL, for example.
0.787085293239933 This too was hoped to be a major disruption, although Microsoft's assistant general counsel at its Digital Crimes Unit, Richard Boskovich, said at the time, "due to Citadel's size and complexity, we do not expect to fully take out all of the botnets in the world using the Citadel malware.".
0.3962988502854064 Trusteer, an IBM company, has just discovered a Citadel
0.0448085654438302 Two examples of these tools include the "IntelegentBot" log-parser plugin and the Citadel Trojan's "Money Panel" plugin.
0.368907915289259 Two of the sources said the malware was the Citadel password stealing program, but that detail hasn't been confirmed.
0.728300936715378 Unlike most modern espionage attacks, this particular Citadel campaign did not initially focus on the targeted companies.
0.2144422148569530 Using many of the hallmarks of open-source project management, the Citadel project looks likely to become a major botnet threat.
0.2306938035048613 Using the Citadel Trojan, criminals are targeting employees to steal their credentials for accessing internal airport applications.

0.246673713359730 We also expect that its targets will expand as more cybercriminals realize the potential capabilities of Citadel go well beyond financial fraud.
0.412064939033601 We discovered the online banking Trojan involved in this campaign to be a variant of the Citadel family.
0.494830494659350 "We expect that [Citadel's] targets will shift as more cybercriminals realize the benefits of Citadel go beyond financial fraud," the report said.

0.0637291705185739 We recently discovered a Citadel sample that suggests a disturbing shift in focus by the cybercriminals running the Trojan.
0.669609339102591 What makes Citadel particularly dangerous is the fact that it is extremely hard to detect, spreads in multiple ways, and is already installed on an estimated 1 in ever 500 systems worldwide, she said.
0.580723310830086 "What we've seen is an interesting group, a low-profile team. This variant is not sold as we've seen other variants sold," Maor said. "The distribution isn't huge, but it is significant. They're very good at protecting stored stolen credentials, and very good at making the malware hard to research. These are not your average hackers; they didn't just buy a version of the Citadel malware. They took the extra step to make it covert and sustainable, and to localize it."
0.602438872065730 While one is for espionage purposes and therefore likely to be and remain tightly targeted, the other involves a criminal gang spreading the Citadel banking trojan.
0.09708396564305 While this may well happen, says McAfee , it is also warning that Citadel currently "remains a very active threat and continues to target victims in several countries.".
0.1915683258099579 With builders for the Citadel Trojan freely available on any number of underground criminal forums, it's no surprise to see some legs left in the malware despite a takedown of more than 1,400 Citadel botnets less than a month ago by U.S. law enforcement and Microsoft.
0.2062660345378474 "With this attack," notes McAfee, "it is clear that the Poetry Group intends to selectively target government agencies around the world using Citadel.
0.611976745207307 Working with U.S. Marshals, the company was able to physically remove from data centers some servers used by Citadel botmasters.
0.6870782117752 "Yes, the people behind Gozi Prinimalka wanted to launch a big campaign and hire 100 botmasters; but we will still have far more attacks from Citadel.".

0.4002174793563021 While I'm not inclined to comment on the accuracy or inaccuracy of these reports in general, I feel obliged to comment on a meme that has come up time and time again in those same reports: it seems to have become 'historical fact' that (a) McAfee announced that 5 million PCs were infected with the Michelangelo boot sector virus, whose highly destructive payload would trigger on March 6th (b) that when March 6th actually rolled round, the predicted devastation proved to be 'hype' or 'a dud'.
0.346420568904828 For example, the Michelangelo virus gained a great deal of media attention, but the actual damage caused by the virus was pretty small.

0.3494870274268857 It is certainly possible that crooks are using Citadel to deploy Reveton, but as I'll illustrate below, it seems more likely that the attackers in these cases are using exploit kits like BlackHole to plant both threats on victim PCs.

0.614390346446584 According to Fried, that's because some of the email addresses listed in Microsoft's complaint as belonging to John Doe miscreants were in fact addresses used by security researchers who had registered domains to serve as "sinkholes" for one or more ZeuS botnets.
0.522316887019970 According to several of my sources who have helped with or participated in the investigation that led to this week's arrests, the group used ZeuS to steal online banking credentials from tens of thousands of victims, but it focused on extracting money from high-dollar commercial accounts belonging to businesses.

0.324621303121496 After that, ZeuS, Andromeda and ad-clicking malware may be installed to capitalize on the weakness.
0.4401788906715430 After ZeuS , an infamous banking Trojan, came Kronos, which is capable of stealing information from highly popular Internet browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome.
0.588286683587280 Afterwards, It downloads an additional malicious executable file which in this case is a Zbot Trojan, a notorious Trojan that is capable of stealing banking information.
0.1474640606732179 Alex Cox, principal research analyst with NetWitness, a Herndon, Va. based security firm, said the attack bears remarkable similarities to the "Hilary Kneber" ZeuS botnet discovered by NetWitness last February.
0.188740000244662 All attack methodology is controlled through the Zeus configuration file.
0.14784895065489 All of the threats from this family in the Top 10 are downloaded onto infected computers by a Trojan from the ZeuS/Zbot family (which we have mentioned numerous times in our reports).
0.680473034247801 All the latest variants of ZeuS had the same algorithm to decrypt a section in their code which contained the Trojan's initial internal settings (a link used to download the configuration file, traffic encryption key, etc. ).

0.492862729662616 Also, many of the domains used in this malware attack have long been associated with ZeuS Trojan activity.
0.1924635231961964 Also of importance to CISOs and other enterprise security professionals is that, according to AppRiver security analyst Jonathan French, some anti-virus products are failing to catch this specific Zeus Trojan variation, even though the Zeus family of Trojans has been around for years.
0.393102141452247 Although applying a digital signature is the most revolutionary improvement, it was not the only upgrade added to Zeus.
0.1297382159129715 Although it is the latest version of the Trojan, an $1,800 price tag pays for a Trojan which still contains more than 98% of Zeus's original code, offers none of the features promised by its author, presents no innovation, and does not seem to pose a real threat.
0.2939843771544141 An alleged cybercrime gang from Ukraine and Russia - two of whom were extradited from the UK - have been charged with using Zeus malware to steal millions of dollars from victims including the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago order of nuns.

0.1141023886384665 An update to the P2P Zeus banking trojan results in the installation of a rootkit driver that makes deleting the malware even tougher.
0.606241910467237 And, after all, there are source codes of ZeuS all over the cyber underground, changing hands and getting upgraded (or spoiled).
0.273441764788192 And it was only a matter of time until a 64-bit version of ZeuS appeared – but we didn't expect it to happen quite so soon.
0.614645835466871 And now please 'welcome' ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.
0.595581594059917 And speaking of botnets, this version of Zeus now comes with a botnet favorite: the Tor privacy network .
0.59879631720020 And the arms race to counter botnets is only going to escalate further now that the sort of peer-to-peer technology used in Kelihos has become commoditized in Zeus, a botnet "platform" at the center of a thriving criminal software ecosystem.

0.1079101466526067 And what are the chances that we will be able to determine that they actually came from the ZeuS author?
0.1633941717616208 Another domain was hosted on an ISP that has seen significant levels of ZeuS-related activity in the past, and is a known haven for cybercrime.
0.308076073598991 Another important milestone in the story of Zeus is on October 1st, 2010, when the FBI announced it had taken down the main cyber crime network which had used Zeus, stealing nearly $70 million.
0.599764095693633 Another noteworthy addition is this ZBOT's user mode rootkit capability, which effectively hides the malware processes, files, and registry.
0.278711642710374 "Another thing which I've seen is that some [ZeuS botnet command servers] are using geo-IP location, [so that] if a ZeuS group just targets U.K. banks, they will do a geo-location restriction on the [control] server, and allow just bots from the U.K." to ping the servers, he wrote in an instant message.

0.680598300733749 As an added bonus, the group also distributes the Zeus botnet software to enable yet more data theft.
0.499425951998444 As expected, a number of the generated domains became active and were found to be hosting new or updated versions of LICAT and ZeuS configuration files.
0.639122117662958 As I have detailed in more than 75 stories on this topic, ZeuS allows attackers to manipulate the victim's browser and to log in to the victim's bank account using the victim's own PC, effectively negating any security that a device fingerprint or registered computer may provide.
0.0819912071323510 As I wrote in a Feb. 2012 piece, Zeus Trojan Author Ran With Spam Kingpins , Slavik was active on multiple crime forums, not only finding new clients and buyers for his malware, but for the goods harvested by his own botnets powered by ZeuS.
0.233291672527824 As is typical of ZBOT variants, it steals a user's personal information, particularly those related to online banking.
0.552890311202814 As it turns, and unlike the Zeus Trojan's encryption, this is not one of the aspects Harderman invested much into.
0.0465059355775296 As previously mentioned, the malicious payloads delivered through the exploit kit are mostly information stealing malware with additional backdoor capabilities: Zeus in 66 percent of the cases and Cridex in 29 percent.
0.219900424279255 As seen with popular desktop malware, such as the infamous Zeus , when source code is leaked a whole load of innovation is born.
0.357258371953503 As well as sinkholing the Zeus malware servers, Microsoft also knocked out many servers that belonged to security researchers and provided a valuable service to the public by notifying system administrators that they had infected computers on their network.
0.3095649308557645 As with other Zeus attacks, this variant launches a man-in-the-browser (MitB) attack.
0.0960822736259545 As you can see in the screenshot, the description of the new program focuses on the enhancements allegedly introduced into the ZeuS original code.
0.0844521182294927 Aside from the information stealing routine configuration file downloaded from the generated domains, some active domains were also found to be hosting new LICAT or ZeuS malware variants namely TSPY_ZBOT.BYZ and PE_LICAT.A-O. The new downloaded samples mostly have different hashes which are detected via the heuristic detection TSPY_ZBOT.SMEQ.
0.2291833372250671 Aside from Zeus, the operators are also using several underground toolkits such as Bleeding Life Exploit Kit, Pony, and Ann Loader.

0.2315000447057248 At the end of 2011 it has been identified a new Zeus variant that uses P2P communication to transfer commands from compromised hosts in a botnet .
0.582840156337200 At the time, it was popular due to its lower cost and the ability to add custom plug-ins, something ZeuS didn't offer.
0.3120715167183286 At the time though, it hadn't yet been operationalized in a widespread way: "Chewbacca is currently not offered in public (underground) forums, unlike other toolkits such as Zeus," Kaspersky noted.

0.748764978390892 Back then, the threat was aimed at banks and other financial institutions, something very reminiscent of other banking Trojans such as Zeus and its variants.
0.255080141643434 Based on the behavior of ZBOT malware samples, there are four main steps we need to accomplish to successfully automate decryption of downloaded configuration file:
0.160472493518061 Based on the fact that the Zeus source-code went public in 2011, the Citadel community indeed became active, and started contributing new modules and features.
0.61206647680106 "Because the Zeus source code was leaked back in 2011, many evolving variants of the bot started to spawn by different cyber-criminal groups," the security team says.

0.729073449067499 Conversely, Zeus' coder had somewhat of a more elegant solution to the cached page issues - upon detecting access to a cached page, Zeus would inject it's HTML code into the copy of the page already cached on disk.
0.508899899707692 Crimeware is developed for a number of purposes -- kits like Zeus focus on creation and management of a malware payload, others control web traffic, and others focus on infecting users through web attacks -- and one example is Blackhole.

0.644299529079629 "Each time you have a group or piece of malware that starts to get near the level of heat or public attention that ZeuS has gotten over the past year, it's inevitable that the bad guys are going to transition to something that's not on everyone's radar," Santorelli said.
0.305032301064693 Earlier this month, we discussed several ZBOT samples that in addition to using Tor for its C&C connection, also embeds its 64-bit version "inside" the normal, 32-bit version.
0.0556402867780233 Earlier this week Amit Klein, CTO of Trusteer, announced the discovery of a peer-to-peer variant of the Zeus platform that leverages trusted relationships and well-known brands to convince users to sign up for convenient services and better secure debit card transactions.

0.378377511444986 "Early Zbot versions employed a user-mode rootkit that would hide the Zbot directory and registry entries from user-land tools," noted James Wyke, Sophos researcher, in a blog . "However, by Version 2 of the malware, this rootkit had been dropped as it was largely ineffective. Instead, Zbot began to inject its code into system processes and browsers, hooking important software functions in order to snoop on the data passing through the system."

0.4444539896149819 Even though it is shorter, this new version of Zeus is capable of performing sophisticated tasks that could cause great harm to the infected host.
0.209189904178851 Ever since the source code of the Zeus crimeware kit , also known as Zbot , was leaked onto the internet in May 2011, many new variants have appeared.
0.690668384493200 Every P2P Zeus binary would extract the version number from the update packet and compare the version number that is hardcoded in its body.
0.4296656748827839 Every P2P Zeus code analyzes the version number from the update packet, and compares it with the one hardcoded in its code to evaluate the necessity to update itself.

0.768259973173234 Faking the trojan to be a certificate is also a trick that ZeusMitmo has used.
0.0881054503065394 Figure 22: Malwarebytes Anti-Malware showing detection for Zeus/Zbot Trojan.
0.3949470174584216 File infectors and ZBOT don't usually go together, but we recently saw a case where these two kinds of threats did.
0.593776966092151 FireEye claims that this part of the botnet works with a Zeus variant that is well-known for rapidly changing command and control(C&C).
0.42663373266131 First, ZeuS/ZBOT variants are known to steal information related to online banking credentials..
0.1616022286009313 Following last September's turn of events, where several individuals were arrested for using information stealing Trojans known as the ZeuS toolkit, a much anticipated "upgrade" was inevitable so that it could continue its money-making ploy.
0.304772132528033 For example, banking Trojan Zeus has a range of technologies to steal payment data.
0.2673305321429980 For example, consider the infamous Zeus -a multi-purpose Trojan capable of steal banking information-is freely available to anyone who can find the leaked source code and compile it.
0.1511579166127322 For example, in 2013 hackers targeted NFL fans through fake Facebook pages that were seeded with malicious links serving Zeus malware.
0.362370908357515 For example, security researchers identified one ZeuS variant that was specific to the Ukrainians known as JabberZeuS because it alerted the gang via Jabber instant message whenever online banking credentials for customers of specific institutions were stolen.
0.264860740855799 For example, the Zeus Trojan variant known as Citadel has been seen in the wild targeting non-banking firms, including a petrochemical manufacturer, according to IBM's Trusteer security division.
0.4612468841020458 For example, ZitMo (the mobile 'twin' of Zeus, the infamous Win32 banking Trojan) has been on record since 2010, but until lately it was not known to have been used in mass attacks.
0.2942535829559891 For more information on ZeuS, you may check out our report, Zeus and Its Continuing Drive Toward Stealing Online Data.
0.1237159056613188 For now malware writers must write executables for both Windows and the mobile OS (most often it's Android, although ZeuS attacks others too).
0.4291465793385933 For now, older ZBOT variants will represent the bulk of infection threats.
0.4829885113041656 For sure, there have been other threats, but each has paled in comparison to Zeus in terms of longevity and distribution and - ultimately - effectiveness.
0.623154979580813 For those who may want to read about a recent incident where Zeus was involved in a $ 150, 000 robbery:
0.1282936413389155 For years, the Zeus trojan has been the gold standard among banking malware.
0.1095415984430753 Fox-IT notes, many of the users of KINS have already migrated to yet another ZeuS
0.2654698454452557 From what I can see, cybercriminals using ZeuS intentionally did this to prevent security researchers from easily gathering information on their activities.
0.556168312908849 F-Secure saw 644 URLs, mostly in the US, targeted by Zeus's Web-injections over the six month span.
0.583314968290956 Furthermore, traditional banking malware like ZeuS/Citadel is not the only malware which hit JP banks.
0.1222785514029681 Furthermore, while Zeus usually hijacks the user session and performs wire transactions, this variant crawled the site and created a real time copy of the user's Salesforce.com instance that contained all the information from the company account.
0.79544295121619 Gary Warner, Malcovery's chief technologist, published a blog post to describe how Zeus variant uses encryption to bypass perimeter security.
0.531202788211058 Given the strong feelings that Microsoft's actions have engendered in the Fox IT folks and among the larger security community, I reached out to Richard Boscovich , a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who was one of the key architects of Microsoft's legal initiative against ZeuS.
0.360720389534329 Going even further there are some side-branches of Zeus maintained by other cyber criminals.
0.1736656521881202 Google has pushed out an update for its Chrome browser that fixes a problem caused by the incident last week in which Microsoft Security Essentials mistakenly detected the browser as the Zeus bot and removed it from some machines.
0.599224981487178 Greko said that although there are a number of different Zeus versions in circulation, their methods are effective against most of the known variants.
0.507511402441588 Gribo talk that Slavik is completely left from bussiness and he transfered everything related to Zeus 2.0 to Gribo, so he can continue work on this bot, including customers technical support.
0.2084295530907108 Hacker On Hacker Action \u2013 Zeus Botmaster Targets Anonymous Supporters.
0.0639880988368325 Hackers have duped supporters of the Anonymous group into installing the Zeus botnet, which steals confidential information from PCs, including banking usernames and passwords, security researchers said last week.
0.520129051899022 Hackers Modify Zeus to Create Bogus Social Media Buzz.
0.404436174008410 Hackers typically use the exploit kit to drop malware such as botnets built with the Zeus toolkit, rootkits, or fake antivirus packages that coerce users to pay for fraudulent malware protection.
0.605140031264920 Halfway into the third quarter, however, we noticed that TROJ_UPATRE unseated ZBOT and became the top malware attachment.
0.1559507468944445 Has Operation B71 , a collaborative effort to take down Zeus-related botnets, had a major impact?
0.767375109477413 He added that the Zeus variant is not being detected by anti-virus products, and that it bypasses SSL browser security.
0.60342139179700 He added that the Zeus variant would work to the favor of criminals targeting retailers, since "Zeus malware would be useful for exfiltrating stolen credit numbers from point-of-sale terminals to the attackers' infrastructure.".
0.4389563491677812 He brings more than 20 years of experience with him, having served as the CEO of Zeus Technology, an application traffic management company based in the U.K., and as senior vice president at Riverbed Technology, a San Francisco-based IT performance firm that acquired Zeus Technology in 2011.
0.266629711116120 He had already been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud in 2012, for an early version of Zeus known as Jabber Zeus.
0.576749281165101 He noted that Zeus working via Tor is nothing new, reviewing samples with signs of Tor communications dating back to 2012 when, along with a Zeus infection, the Tor proxy and Tor hidden service were rolled out on infected machines.
0.696823266965022 He observed that much as the leak of the ZeuS code may soon give some enterprising malware coder ideas about how to extend the capabilities of an existing malware family, it appears that someone has taken a tried-and-true bot family and jazzed it up with a new set of wheels.
0.455375266402571 He was charged with other offenses related to his roles in CryptoLocker and earlier versions of ZeuS.
0.3227122867333882 He will instead create new malware (either ZeuS or entirely new families) that he will then primarily sell to high-value clients.
0.2444925547541607 Here is an example screenshot of the updated HTML form data - If the target victim fills in this information, then Zeus will send this information off to it's command and control host.
0.771781518184830 Historically, Zeus-using online criminals have tended to focus their efforts on better-known banks, especially in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.
0.780481773479619 How banking institutions could make wiser investments to stave off the impact of Zeus; Why Zeus' longevity poses new and increasing concerns for security practitioners; How information sharing could improve protections aimed at thwarting malicious attacks waged by Zeus.
0.0493273283226721 However, analysis reveals that the sample does contain the ZBOT code and this only means that this ZBOT variant only loads the clickbot routine.
0.0848882636024456 However, downloader capability is not a functionality seen in ZeuS to date, therefore further analysis is taking place on this file.
0.544638427766773 However, if they follow this instruction, employees wind up downloading malware that, according to AppRiver security researchers who discovered the campaign, is a new Zeus Trojan variant that steals confidential information and sends it to an adversary's command and control server.
0.743112533412138 However, it could also be merely the consequence of compiler optimization - the result of compiling the bot's code might have been slightly different from that for the original ZeuS code due to the changes, albeit small, introduced into Ice IX. In the ZeuS 2.0.8.9 code, the function that reads data from the registry includes all the API functions required for this task, i. e., RegOpenKeyEx, RegQueryValueEx and RegCloseKey: Figure 3.
0.716642775086221 However, some new samples of the Zeus bot have surfaced that include new features, indicating that development of the tool is still underway.
0.064008436850776 However, the attachment contains a malicious downloader, which downloads Zeus malware in order to steal passwords and user names, as well as monitor specific visited websites.
0.3238604413260962 "However, the attachment was far from innocent. It contained a relatively simple Trojan downloader, that having infected the target machine, would then draw down further payloads to the compromised machine," explained Fred Touchette, AppRiver's senior security analyst, in an emailed statement. "In most of these cases Zeus activity was noticed after the initial infection."
0.464917943765523 However, the code itself looks completely different than in ZeusMitmo.
0.454566712703872 However, the code section responsible for finding and processing email credentials was commented out in the original ZeuS source code.
0.0735254655457074 Hüssy said while there are criminal technologies being built into malware that try to prevent ZeuS Tracker from being able to follow ZeuS botnet infrastructure, he's fairly sure he has managed to bypass it.
0.05347855240787280 Huge amounts of corporate data started flowing to Zeus drop sites: corporate access credentials, sensitive emails and memos, customer data, pricing information, financial records\u2026 The list is endless.
0.762340998998856 Hundreds of new ZeuS variants are seen by Trend Micro every day and this is not likely to change in the near future.
0.0909136356398323 I am sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if therre is any possibility for you to get or build the zeus trojan for me.
0.277309977556415 I can recall a few ZeuS/ZBOT samples targeting Yandex services, but I definitely can't recall anyone targeting MDM Bank or other online Russian banking systems.
0.717421626048497 "I don't think the attack methods are unique from traditional keylogger and Zeus methods," Litan says. "But what is lethal here is the combination and packaging of various tried-and-true hacking techniques."
0.290820363151378 I got a look on the zeus builder who was released by the MMBB guy on exploit.in, finally i'm decided to write something about it, so let's talk about the change in the config encryption.
0.0930427291721919 I had one case two years ago where there was a Zeus bot infection, and they [the victim organization] dismissed it as common malware," Hoglund says
0.2874653514566931 I remember when the Zeus source code was leaked and people started developing their own malware, the chats in the different underground forums was about who they were going to get support from," Maor said.
0.703482691719364 I was reminded of this reality by a feature built into a recent version of the infamous ZeuS trojan that makes it even easier for the crooks to ignore everything except for the goods they're seeking.
0.5834016671705 If a phone number is provided, the user will receive an SMS link pointing to the mobile component, ZeusMitmo.
0.655865061275877 If the server is already inaccessible, the ZBOT malware will unable to download the dynamic configuration file that contains the targeted banking URLs.
0.623578415930255 If the source code for Cryptolocker leaks, then innovation will only spike, as it did with Zeus when its insides we exposed , Lozhkin adds.
0.04034944210433044 "If the ZeuS leak was like giving a machine gun for free, giving away exploit kits is like providing the ammo.
0.3489352133464209 "If the ZeuS leak was like giving a machine gun for free, giving away exploit kits is like providing the ammo. We will now see much more use of those exploit and malware kits by less talented groups of cyber criminals," said Aviv Raff, CTO at security firm Seculert, said at the time of the leak of the free version of Black Hole.
0.79374727479173 If you are not a member of NACHA, Zbot also is happy to send you malicious eCards and online banking notifications, and will be quite pleased to add your computer to the botnet and gather your personal banking information.
0.192650210133298 If you visit one of these "targeted" strings, Zeus might be instructed to send the criminal screenshots every time you click your mouse, to send the criminal all of the contents of your web forms, or even trigger to ask you for your Two Factor Authentication.
0.1664283586114734 If your are one of the victim of Zeus, we recommend that you change your passwords for your online accounts and if you have used your credit card while Zeus Trojan was on your computer, contact the bank and let them know that you might be be victim of a phishing attack..
0.3455452372629108 If Zeus is successfully downloaded, it will work as a typical banking trojan, although it also displays some RAT-like characteristics.
0.1516837261662026 In 2010, according to the F.B.I., over $70 million was stolen from banks in the United States using the Zeus Trojan.
0.229523366639294 In 2011, Zbot's source code went public and was used to create (and is still being used to create) new variants of malicious programs, which is impacting attack statistics.
0.2839137708466048 In a lab run of several Zbot samples, I noticed that on average it takes Zbot less than a minute to upload cached passwords.
0.2287672294372988 In a slight variation to this tactic, Malwarebytes and French security researcher Xylitol collaborated in February 2014 to release findings on a new variant of Zeus that used steganography by concealing malware code in JPG images.
0.0632136153556160 In addition, past versions of Zeus left a loophole in which security professionals were able to instruct Zeus to download a new version "upgrade" designed to actually disable the Zeus Trojan on the infected PC; essentially destroying a botnet.
0.514913812557567 In addition to its normal information theft routines, it also infected executable files on systems-a behavior not usually seen in previous ZeuS variants.
0.3434422787974500 In addition to the data theft and financial fraud Zeus is known for, PLXSert has discovered Zeus being used in crypto-currency mining, spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and attacks customized for specific PaaS and SaaS infrastructure.
0.0820507356844363 In addition, using RTF files to spread ZBOT is unusual, as it's typically spread via other means such as downloaders, malicious sites, or spam.
0.577565573986621 In an example analyzed by ThreatMetrix Labs, Zeus targets a major department store.
0.0677842579628756 In another series of targeted attacks, cybercriminals using the Zeus Trojan launched a campaign directed at employees responsible for accounting in small firms.
0.443477081529716 In contrast, ZeuS previously used modules that had to be included when the toolkit was sold.
0.625404366269303 In fact, it seems to want to swipe information of a very similar nature to a ZBot infection from August of 2012 detailed on the ShadowServer Blog ," GFI's Chris Boyd wrote in an anlysis of the attack.
0.1210427379247328 In fact, the great majority of them have never heard of things like zero-day vulnerabilities, botnets, Mini Flame or the Zeus Trojan (click on the screenshot to enlarge it):
0.1171253646876809 In February, another Zeus variant stole corporate data through a compromised system whose user had logged into the cloud service, according to Adallom.
0.252407012114037 In function it is similar to other "bankers" in the wild, especially Zbot.
0.3914943455901531 In late 2010, authorities in the United Kingdom and Ukraine arrested and detained several individuals for developing and profiting from custom versions of the ZeuS Trojan.

0.589192983597706 In my last post , I talked about some of the MITB attacks currently being used by modern banking trojans like URLZone and Zeus/Zbot.
0.1370617226083786 In order to create greater distinction we've seen a security company give a particular Zeus botnet another name when talking about it in the media.
0.361167854517776 In short, they are to PoS terminals what ZeuS, Citadel, and other banking trojans are to online bank accounts.
0.490884839395400 In some cases, the cadence of such automated activity can indicate the difference between a user attempting to crawl and download their Salesforce contact list using a script like Wget (insider threat), and a malicious crawler built into certain malware packages like Zeus (external threat).
0.3520409557191497 In the past months cyber criminals implemented an efficient commercial model for the distribution of the famous Zeus Trojan, the malware that is designed as an open project that can be customized with new features to meet customer demands.
0.4438959369272590 In the past, we've written about a ZeuS variant that might not infect slow computers as a result of aggressive anti-debugging techniques.
0.143710311278589 In the screen shot above, the ZeuS author can be seen selling surplus "installs," offering to rent hacked machines that fellow forum members can seed with their own spam bots (I have added a translation beneath each line).
0.747671315091837 In this case, the HTML of the bank login page is placed inside a virtual Russian doll, which provides a layer of obfuscation ZeuS is not currently prepared to handle.
0.326748883333852 In this most recent spam campaign, our spam traps caught an uncanny combination of a CapitalOne phish and a ZBOT variant.
0.295427415580340 In this particular case we had an interest of our own, since the ZeuS malware made a lot of Dutch victims as well.".
0.367785000711593 In this short blog post, I'm going to share just one of those techniques (using edit-distance) that you can plug into your multi-part system to perform rudimentary detection for popular crimeware admin panel strains like Pony, Citadel, and Zeus.
0.697508947068066 Indeed, injects are frequently sold on the underground for other criminals to integrate into their Zbot or Citadel crimeware..
0.442747874481017 Instead, you must send a specially formed POST request to a certain address (which is actually a URL hardcoded into the bot in the same location as in ZeuS 2.0.8.9).
0.253664285211367 Is a simple, indiscriminate Zeus infection a noteworthy incident?
0.2905932273568455 It also borrows ZeuS's form-grabbing functionality and hooks the browser's HTTP POST function.
0.3530835362164085 It also creates a new registry key to make Zeus run every time the computer is restarted.
0.612623480280262 It is also a good answer to popular community based domains blacklisting resources like Zeus tracker and Malware Domain List .
0.2102025354982928 It is believed to be a completely new family of malware, similar to but sufficiently distinct from, the Zeus malware.
0.3716104869796259 It is important to note that we are now seeing an increase of this malware, which can be attributed to UPATRE/ZBOT being distributed as attachments to spammed messages.
0.454583034056486 "It is not clear at this point in time if the same group of people are behind the whole operation, or if multiple gangs collaborated, perhaps with one to drive traffic to the exploit pack and sell the infected computers to another gang operating a botnet based on Win32/Zbot.".
0.1747695671375796 It is this very feature - code injection - that has made ZeuS such a potent weapon in defeating the security mechanisms that many commercial and retail banks use to authenticate their customers.
0.677739947049389 "It looks quite similar to the Zeus banking Trojan\u2026 This isn't a new class of malware.".
0.300426260240814 It turns out that many ZeuS banking trojan investigations were done by the (little known) Omaha (Nebraska, USA) office of the FBI.
0.694822170894539 It uses a different packer and contains sophisticated anti-debugging and anti-analysis routines, but underneath it's still ZeuS: it uses the same folders and file names, injects the same processes, creates the same registry entries, etcetera.
0.3817283729661069 It was actually a tweet back to a story from July 11th where Danielle Walker wrote ZBerp Evolves: Spreads through Phishing Campaign which was actually quoting the July 7th story from WebSense Labs, where Elad Sharf wrote Zeus PIF: The Evolving Strain Looking to Defeat Your Security Software .
0.535025134272278 It was moved among a number of IP addresses including one belonging to a legitimate Scottsdale business known as previous host to Ice IX malware and a Zeus control server with the domain brainrace.ru.
0.3387894248885884 It wasn't until the company hired an outside forensics expert who removed the hard drive and examined it in an isolated environment that the expert found the ZeuS infection.
0.2182836179225945 It's a back-end Web database designed to interact with a collection of Windows PCs infected by the ZeuS Trojan.
0.687041346720635 It's not the long-awaited Zeus for Mobile; it cannot sneak into mobile banking applications and listen in; it is not even designed to capture mobile browsing traffic.
0.771228751050403 It's somewhat bemusing to see that there is no honour between thieves, as Corkow's routines for web injection and form-grabbing appears to be based on the leaked Zeus source code.
0.341878899495151 It's the main difference with this, and a standard web inject inside Zeus.

0.315773411518543 KINS has a modular structure, basic offer includes a bootkit, a dropper, DLLS and Zeus-compatible Web injects.
0.772306541692526 KINS is the "ideal candidate" for cyber criminals in search of the next major banking trojan because it's commercially available, easy to use (much like Zeus) and is offered with technical support, Limor Kessem, a cyber crime and online fraud expert at RSA's FraudAction Research Lab, said in a Tuesday blog post.
0.2045655435917084 KINS on a malicious server with SSL for MitB webinject: Zeus 2.0.9.15: To finish...

0.0524519128063245 Security firm Trusteer said it has identified a little-known Windows malware platform that rivaled ZeuS in sophistication and functionality.
0.410271208872933 Security researchers at Kaspersky Lab have discovered five new samples of the ZeuS-in-the-Mobile (ZitMo) malware package, targeting Android and BlackBerry devices.
0.717414011232739 Security researchers over the weekend noticed that files that appeared to contain the source code for the Zeus crimeware kit were starting to pop up on various forums frequented by attackers and cybercriminals.
0.505649849547798 Segura explained that to decode it, it's possible to reverse the file with a debugger such as OllyDbg and grab the decryption routine - or, use the leaked Zeus source code to create one's own module that will decompress the data blocks.

0.590815780200232 Significant update to P2P Zeus botnet malware ( Fortinet ).
0.1744520975544969 Since its source code was leaked in 2011, it seems that nearly every banking trojan has flavors of Zeus built into it.
0.2487242121090428 Since Microsoft announced Operation B71 , I've heard from several researchers who said they were furious at the company for publishing data on a group of hackers thought to be behind a major of the ZeuS botnet activity - specifically those targeting small to mid-sized organizations that are getting robbed via cyber heists.
0.346565016555181 Since the experts started to monitor the Zeus P2P botnet traffic, they have observed that the version number reported in the encrypted update packets is passed from 0×38 (September 2013) to 0x3B (detected on April 8th 2014).
0.418110863765136 Since the rest of the Trojan remained exactly the same, all one would need to do in order to decode Ice IX configuration files, is to copy-paste Zeus v2.0s' decoding mechanism, and substitute the characters "gss" chose.
0.79657153471119 Since this malware injects itself into certain processes, there are instances that a reboot is required: As ZeuS/ZBOT malware downloads newer version of itself, the binary itself may not be detected but could generally act the same.
0.1388295575916552 Since Zeus downloads a configuration file from a predefined location, competing criminals or security professionals could kidnap an entire botnet by planting a 'poisoned' configuration file into the fraudsters' C&C server.
0.1213255075510295 Since Zeus is a commercially available malware kit, the key metric here is the number of botnets and NOT the number of bots (infected end devices).
0.436605263593629 Site members are believed to have traded in compromised databases containing thousands of personal details including bank account numbers, PIN numbers, passwords and malware including the Zeus Trojan and other types of criminal software, including credit card verification programs.
0.564619794508868 Slowloris DDoS tool used by Anonymous hacked to include Zeus trojan.
0.602033216036418 Smith's take: The attackers aren't taking over accounts with Zeus, but instead are focusing on wearing down banks' fraud and DDoS mitigation teams, because most institutions have limited resources in those areas.
0.730067776015334 So, it is very clear that we must focus attention on these threats and take into account that this "modified version of ZeuS" has been In-the-Wild since the beginning of year.

0.4643710167657908 The attack began sometime before May 9, when thieves stole the online banking credentials for Tennessee Electric, presumably with some type of malicious software such as the ZeuS Trojan.
0.354453122517661 The attack on Village View demonstrates the sophistication of malicious software like the ZeuS Trojan .
0.2890468645147530 "The attackers are clearly financially motivated and seem to offer services to other actors," said Fox-IT, noting that the exploit kit behind the attacks dropped six different types of malware, including the Zeus banking Trojan, Dorkbot, and a click-fraud Trojan.
0.32890937551265 The attacks come after the developers of the Citadel Trojan, which is a variant of the Zeus banking malware, had a major break with the community of cyber-criminals that collaborate on various underground Web forums-or sites.
0.508551386837659 The attacks were discovered by security firm Malwarebytes, who say that those targeted were being infected with the notorious ZeuS banking Trojan, the pernicious Cryptolocker ransomware, as well as various other threats.
0.0678072653002076 The author of Ice IX simply removed the comment marks from this code, so the modules that were not included in ZeuS 2.0.8.9 samples were present in his bot.
0.28774988395261 The availability of Zeus and Citadel code, however, lowers the cost for attackers to employ some anti-sandboxing techniques.
0.1149224427835838 The Black Hole exploit kit is somewhat newer and less well-known than attack toolkits such as Zeus and Eleonore, but it has been used by attackers for major Web-based attacks for the last few months.
0.769836671499706 The botnet infrastructure for Citadel, described as a sophisticated cousin of the Zeus banking trojan , is believed to be responsible for the theft of more than a half-billion dollars worldwide.
0.594904952933718 The botnet that spread the malware, which was a variant of the Zeus botnet framework, also was used to launch distributed denial of service attacks.
0.1528878229946155 The capabilities of malware specialists and their effort to improve Zeus core functionalities are impressive, for example, many instances are able to detect the presence of other Zeus variant on the victim's machine and disinfect them, other authors are more focused on the development of obfuscated payloads to make more difficult to detect and block the malicious agent.
0.0685931185753109 The C&C panel includes all the necessary files functions to manage a botnet, the Zeus toolkit requires very little skill to operate, " the Zeus operator simply runs the /install/index.php page and provides some basic information - a username, passwords for the panel and the MySQL database, and the encryption key to be used for bot communication with the control panel.".
0.2051319982757485 The Citadel malware is a close cousin of the Zeus crimeware kit and typically is used as a banker Trojan, stealing users' online banking credentials and allowing attackers to drain victims' bank accounts.

0.703520848267567 The former is similar to ZitMo - its main function is to intercept one-time passwords (transaction authorization numbers).
0.599645414569761 The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry is the same: C&C cell phone number, SMS commands, and the ability to forward SMS messages from a particular number, as well as the ability to change C&C. The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Android is far more primitive.
0.348842364655057 The gangs behind Gumblar, Zeus and other massive Web-based attacks have relied on browser-based exploits for much of their success, and experts say that these well-known attacks are just the ripples on the surface of what is a much larger sea of exploits targeting all of the major browsers.
0.2459620632388356 The intrusions and information harvesting is done with the help of sophisticated mobile malware such as PERKEL and ZITMO.

0.0680070282951450 The leak has echoes of the release of the Zeus crimeware source code a couple of years ago and has security researchers concerned that it may lead to a similar crop of new Trojans and crimeware kits.
0.4148084183891892 The links lead to malicious sites, which are instances of the Blackhole v2 exploit kit, and which ultimately lead to the download of a Zeus bot variant.
0.373497545536200 The links led to Blackhole exploits and a Zeus Trojan disguised as an Adobe Flash Player download.
0.783469921115445 The list from its configuration file seems longer than most of the typical of ZeuS variants and the domain names looked atypical.
0.668954890070720 The lure email emails used by Zeus PIF often hold subjects used to lure a target to run a file from a URL and according to the team are of good quality; containing no spelling mistakes and convincing imagery.
0.407078526136239 The magistrate was unswayed by evidence presented by Patco's lawyers that modern malware threats like ZeuS can modify content in the victim's browser (and thus prompt users for the answers to all of their secret questions).
0.593590439263974 The malicious file followed the same naming convention as the legitimate Opera auto update files but was much smaller: A number of Opera's estimated 300 million users may have been infected with a nasty Trojan downloader part of the Zbot family.
0.3826694819357716 "The malware also includes a basic ZeuS webinject template, but each customer in the ZeuS P2P CaaS can modify and add new advanced webinjects and increase the number of targets," Kruse said.
0.1071052933369257 The malware first emerged around September 2011 as the latest version of the Zeus malware.
0.1716154488954099 The malware is based on the leaked code of Zeus and RAM-scraping malware.

0.486643720658864 The new variants are usually the result of rebuilding that can be carried out with minimum fuss using programs known as ZeuS Builder kits.
0.721042980635487 The news is, some smart malware pimp managed to dupe a whole bunch of Anonymous supporters into installing the Zeus botnet - when they thought they were getting a DDoS tool.
0.33651128392102 The notorious banking Trojan emerged after the source code for the Zeus Trojan was leaked in 2011, and it employs a number of evasion tactics including the ability to detect files and processes used by virtualization software, make comparisons against known profiles of online sandboxes such as Anubis, or sleeping until recognizing what it interprets as human movements.
0.529729750940173 The notorious ZBot family of malware (also known as Zeus) can hijack your computer, making it part of a criminal botnet.
0.662368085294384 The original Zbot used encryption in several places to make aspects of its operation harder to detect.
0.369290904750409 The paper finishes with the following prediction: 'they [attacks involving ZitMo] will become more specifically targeted against a smaller number of victims'.
0.0695933018114659 The particularity of Zeus is that it acts as a " man-in-the-browser " allowing cyber-crooks to collect personal information from its victims as well as to surreptitiously perform online transactions.
0.2493269971903735 The 'partner' program intercepts the victim's online banking credentials, and then it is up to ZitMo to obtain the one-time passwords used in online banking systems to authorize transactions and send them to cybercriminals, who will use the data to steal money from the victims' bank accounts.
0.2447181769749806 The payload of this threat is to install ZeuS variants onto user systems in order to steal sensitive information from users.
0.737611302911223 The popularity and pervasiveness of Zeus/Zbot has made it almost a synonym for banking malware, but there are unfortunately many more types of malicious software that allow attackers to steal money from their victims.
0.381086605637623 The post Facebook Zeus malware targeting bank accounts appeared first on Security Affairs .
0.416545776774332 The previous version of Zeus, version 2.0, also included several features that were less talked about such as: Victim's Address Book - One of the things Zeus does when it infects a machine is go to the "Protected Storage" and steal all the data from it.
0.2283139609357641 The Prolexic Security Engineering and Response Team (PLXSert) has released a threat advisory outlining new payloads from the Zeus toolkit that it has seen in the wild.
0.443869765719268 The proliferation of commercial banking thefts involving the ZeuS Trojan and other sophisticated attack tools underscores the asymmetry between the attackers and defenders.
0.725706309613466 The reality is that there are many, many different Zeus botnets all maintained by different cyber criminals.
0.305986015178238 The .reloc section contains some information needed by Zbot for some of its malicious activities.
0.696577148809852 The replacement of a Zeus client for the "Slowloris" DDoS tool took place on the day after Anonymous launched strikes against websites operated by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and others in retaliation for the arrest of four men associated with the popular Megaupload "cyberlocker" site on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.
0.322424281556992 The report, by security firm Trusteer, says firms like Nochex, a small-business centered online payment company, Web Money and Money Booker have all been the target of multiple Zeus variants - 26 in the case of Money Booker, a service that allows consumers to make online payments without the hindrance of having to disclose personal information.
0.18667006076199 The report cites several examples of such 'malicious actors', including a cyber criminal the FBI found last year who was selling a Zeus botnet Trojan and accepting Bitcoin as a payment and another incident in which a Lulzsec member used Bitcoin to purchase a botnet.
0.504287040671371 The report foresees 2011 being fraught with mobile device insecurities, particularly on iPhones and Android phones, as well as the further proliferation of the Zeus botnet. .
0.353846636464650 The researchers discovered that the image used by the Zeus variant is much larger of the original image found with a simple research made with Google because cybercriminals added additional data encrypted using Base64 encoding and then RC4 and XOR encryption algorithms.
0.279460565942657 The researchers noted another interesting detail, some of the Zeus parameters were hard-coded, and this and this suggests that discovered variant was used as a specially crafted tool in a larger attack.
0.746882726853486 The researchers then found crash reports akin to the POS malware used against Target and other retailers, mostly from a large clothing retailer in the Eastern U.S. "This was massively different from a normal Zeus infection.
0.3475329052555178 The rumors that the developers of Zeus - the world's most popular piece of crimeware - may soon shut down shop, spread like wildfire a few weeks ago in the fraud underground.
0.1392923297731214 The secondary file that is dropped is jiubl.exe , which we detect as TSPY_ZBOT.WCDA.
0.1070436696528055 The security firm adds that given the spread of the attack and its poor detection rates, it's "very hard for law enforcement agencies to investigate and mitigate," hinting that the module's creators may have collaborated with another group to popularize the exploit kit only to sell the infected computers to a group running a Win32/Zbot botnet.
0.4603876145869940 The security industry has monitored since its beginnings the evolution of the Zeus malware.
0.737860764277392 The servers and the domains hosted on them were allegedly being used to spread multiple Zeus botnets and collect key-logging data from infected computers, a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday.
0.438206899697614 The shield-ec scareware scam was unique because the purveyors pitched it as "the result of a two-year research collaboration of programmers and analysts from Martindale Enterprises and ZeusTracker, the main center for ZeuS epidemic prevention.".
0.1853678600246572 The source code leak also necessarily means that Zeus is now fully exposed to research, meaning that anyone using parts of the source code for their own Trojan creations will make it easier for malware researchers to analyze and reverse-engineer the code.
0.585530716812351 The source code to the infamous Zeus crimeware kit, which has been sold on underground forums for years, has been leaked and is now available for anyone to see if they know where to look.
0.1778330449912309 The spread of the banking mobile Trojans of ZitMo is especially frustrating, because they act in conjunction with the Trojans on PCs and allow a bypassing of two-step verification used by banks and payment services to prevent frauds.
0.780444765619758 The takedown of some of the Zeus botnet's command and control (C&C) servers has been welcomed, but with a warning that the threat has not gone altogether.
0.2866995100672523 The top three detected malware family types were: ZeuS (banking trojan), Citadel (banking trojan), and Asprox (spambot).
0.1709172759539119 The upshot is clear: Shrugging off the threat posed by older malware ("But it's only a ZeuS infection\u2026") is not just risky.

0.620050790720437 Amongst the many interesting sections of the report is a discusson of the notorious Blackhole exploit kit, which we have written about frequently on Naked Security..
0.353463935230161 An out-of-the-blue tweet from a Dutch researcher kicked off an unprecedented 24-hour rumor mill yesterday concerning the arrest of Paunch, a hacker allegedly behind the notorious Blackhole Exploit Kit.
0.553253113932750 And obviously, the overlap we've seen for a while now too, the exploits work their way from zero-day targeted attacks, and then turn around a few weeks later and that same exploit is now in BlackHole exploit kit.

0.364661652915812 As a continuation of our efforts to protect customers as outlined in our previous post , this post is an update on the current Black Hole Exploit Kit spam run activity.
0.598565255115948 As demonstrated in the Trend Micro report " Continuous Monitoring in a Virtual Environment ," traditional cybersecurity tools such as antivirus software may no longer be sufficient to beat back the rising tide of APTs, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware such as CryptoLocker and modularized malware such as FLAME and the BlackHole exploit kit.
0.517843993411520 As for Blackhole, there are still a handful of attack groups using it, but Kafeine said that he has seen about a 98 percent drop in the usage of that exploit kit since the arrest of Paunch.
0.610721078999748 As for the files themselves, we will publish a technical analysis of the PDF and Jar exploits served by the new version of Blackhole in a later blog post.

0.318587998141278 As noted last week , this is actually very similar to Blackhole exploit kit .
0.245913822070869 As one of the primary names behind Blackhole, Paunch kept the toolkit current as new weaknesses in commonly used programs were discovered: in 2012 Paunch released Blackhole 2.0 , and recent custom versions of the toolkit incorporated ways to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Java's browser plugin .

0.458001456969490 As predicted, since his arrest in early October, the two kits - of which Blackhole was the most used one - stopped receiving updates and the exploits they wielded got stale, making the kits a way less effective tools than before.

0.589846852825475 Summary: The alleged creator of notorious malware toolkit Blackhole has been arrested by Russian police.
0.2723680720323461 "Sure enough, within a week, CVE-2012-1889 exploiting code very similar to that published to Metasploit was seen within the landing page of a Blackhole exploit kit site," Sophos researcher Fraser Howard wrote in a blog post.
0.4291881401156022 Thanks to fellow SpiderLabs colleague Daniel Chechik for his input and for wandering into this particular Blackhole kit.
0.712360617814538 The advert for BlackHole 2.0 was spotted on the underground forum site Exploit.ln, and was translated from Russian with the help of Google Translate by the Malware Don't Need Coffee blog team..
0.0432933035821402 The Andromeda spam botnet is a good example of this trend, this time with aid of the Blackhole Exploit kits (BHEK) and some new neat tricks.
0.47754600053413 The Angler kit is a recent tool appeared in the underground as condequence of the arrest for the alleged creator of Blackhole exploit kit .
0.468524851884796 The arrest of alleged hacker Paunch and the subsequent dismantling of the Blackhole Exploit Kit operation has cybercrime groups scrambling to find another automated means of delivering exploits.
0.50048748645781 The arrest of Paunch and the demise of Blackhole certainly had a dramatic effect on cybercrime incidents - but it was only a temporary effect.
0.0475883895638257 The attackers who had relied on Blackhole were forced to look for alternative ways to deliver programs that can help them steal money.
0.629933361050531 The author of Blackhole, an exploit kit that booby-traps hacked Web sites to serve malware, has done so well for himself renting his creation to miscreants that the software has emerged as perhaps the most notorious and ubiquitous crimeware product in the Underweb.
0.761043855261780 The author of Blackhole is known by the handle Paunch.
0.551363366036108 The author of the Blackhole exploit kit seems to be more comfortable as a system integrator and web application developer than anything else, and is far from being hardcore vulnerability researcher..
0.0711638227319274 The author of the popular Blackhole exploit kit, also know as Paunch, has been arrested.
0.1555372940698852 The Black Hole exploit kit works mainly by controlling user web traffic with various techniques.
0.586825162648768 The Blackhole business model may become the common model, since it works pretty well for the sellers.
0.69994063741399 The Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) spam run has already assumed various disguises during its course.
0.582872922019760 The Blackhole Exploit Kit first reared its ugly head in late 2010, and quickly became a common find for malware researchers investigating compromised websites, and responsible for most of the web attacks that were seen.
0.0638237217719068 The Blackhole exploit kit is a popular and prevalent exploit kit using new zero day and known exploits, to take control of your system when you visit a site that is comprised and infected by the Blackhole kit.
0.719739077369300 The Blackhole exploit kit is fair with the individual exploit functions and doesn't favour any single one of them...
0.35139903229501 The Blackhole Exploit Kit is one of the most notorious exploit kits currently in circulation among the cybercriminal underground today.
0.44635208346305 The Blackhole Exploit Kit may have met its demise, but this hasn't deterred cybercriminals from using other exploit kits for their schemes.
0.3539965035222123 The bot code, generated by the crimeware kit's "builder" component, typically is distributed via social engineering attacks in email and social networking sites, or is foisted by an exploit pack like Eleonore or Blackhole, which use hacked Web sites and browser flaws to quietly install the malware.
0.61261501149065 The campaign itself is pretty standard: users are redirected to websites hosting the BlackHole exploit kit, which takes advantage of a browser or plugin vulnerability to install a piece of ransomware on their computers.
0.527416882100635 The creator of the BlackHole exploit kit has added an exploit for it, as well, and that kit is used by a wide range of attackers.
0.561326780391071 The developer of the toolkit, who goes by the handle "Paunch," recently announced the availability of Blackhole 2.0, which removes much of its trove of known and patched exploits, and replaces them with a whole new crop-along with features that will make it harder for antivirus companies and site owners to detect trouble..
0.2183863382145987 The fall of the Blackhole Exploit Kit in 2013 due to the arrest of its creator, Paunch, was a significant event that appreciably changed the threat landscape.
0.672353333090933 The first is CVE-2013-0422, a Java vulnerability that last week had already made its way into exploit kits such as Nuclear and Blackhole.
0.1564346221515581 The following table includes the dates of activity and some of the new organizations being spoofed by Black Hole Exploit Kit spammers: Below is the infection chain for the Black Hole Exploit Kit spam run that spoofed Amazon, AT&T, and PayPal which is just an example of the massive spam runs our experts track and release solutions for as the attacks occur: As this activity continues, we will continue to track and ensure that solutions for these runs remain effective and release updated solutions as necessary.
0.3248522097214958 The infection source is spam redirected into some redirector pages to be forwarded to the landing page of the most popular exploit kit, Blackhole, at the eziponoma.ru:8080.
0.381984889454309 The kit also lacks operational security features which would make the campaigns harder to detect and analyze, so it definitely can't compete with the Blackhole exploit kit.
0.290299648554688 The landing page appears similar to that of Blackhole.
0.73235916992619 The landing pages are different in all the attacks, but some look like they could have been set up since the recent advent of the new version of the Blackhole exploit kit ..
0.2447840574454912 The last info I have was from a year ago, when Blackhole protection was restricted to be used on 28 servers.
0.067136164358158 The latest of these is a notification alert about "activity you may have missed on Facebook": Clicking on any of the offered buttons or the "unsubscribe" link ultimately lands users on a page hosting the Blackhole exploit kit serving an exploit for Adobe Reader and Acrobat.
0.502800989903507 The links are legitimate compromised websites redirecting to the Blackhole exploit server.
0.1754593627596108 The links eventually lead to sites that host the Blackhole Exploit Kit, which we detect as JS_BLACOLE.TPY.
0.358864953327087 The Linux/CDorked attackers are using Blackhole exploit kit v4 .
0.41464012620125 The long awaited patch for the CVE-2012-1889 vulnerability that has been heavily exploited in the wild and the exploit for which has even been included in the Blackhole Exploit Kit is not the only big news from the users that it has made available an automated Microsoft Fix it solution (a workaround - not a patch) that disables the Windows Sidebar and Gadgets on supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, because of a number of vulnerabilities that involve the execution of arbitrary code by the Windows Sidebar when running insecure Gadgets.
0.2690064187845623 The malicious program is downloaded and installed using the BlackHole Exploit Kit.
0.764269293967743 The most popular injection was related to the Blackhole Exploit kit, covering almost 3,000 websites.
0.629587375309259 The new version offered many options, including statistics about Windows 8 and Mobile Device infection, an option to have "less obvious" URLs for your Blackhole Exploit address, and the ability to automatically regenerate your .exe files in ways that would not be detected by AV engines.
0.04036511995468161 The number of crimeware kits sold in online black markets dropped by 87 percent after Russian authorities last fall arrested "Paunch," the alleged creator of the "Blackhole" kit.
0.49866571322235 The offer, of course, is false, and clicking on links in the email will only trigger multiple redirections that are typical among Blackhole exploit kit (BHEK) spam runs.
0.0803528548774629 The one main group that's using Blackhole is known as /closest/ and has been pushing out LinkedIn spam with malicious links to pages that deliver the exploits.
0.2345734125889974 The perfect example of these developments is the release of Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) 2.0, which was a direct response to successful efforts to block previous BHEK versions.
0.490963018438247 The reason that nothing happened is that the javascript that is running in the background is trying to load a web page known for hosting the BlackHole exploit kit .
0.4701906617943437 The recent emergence of Cryptolocker as one of the most widespread, visible and deadly threats is directly tied to the arrest of "Paunch", the creator of the infamous Blackhole and Cool exploit kits.
0.579462666811284 The reporter wrote the developer behind Blackhole said he is hoping to add the exploit to the main version of the kit soon.
0.3438430232272180 The researchers have analyzed 245 spam runs leading to the Blackhole kit started in April, May and June They have come to believe that all of these attacks were conducted by a single group or several groups acting in concert with one another, since the botnets sending out spam had a high degree of overlap from one day to the next, compromised sites were used and reused from one attack to another, and the exploit methods used in attacks were similar.
0.537959801526752 The researchers tried to profile the campaign discovering that the Black Hole Exploit Kit serving URL was used for other previous client-side exploit serving campaigns, in 2012 the same IP was also seen in fact during a malvertising campaign .
0.2757985803658158 The rise and fall of Paunch and the market leading Blackhole Web malware exploitation kit - The Blackhole Web malware exploitation kit , represented the primary growth factor for a huge percentage of the successful client-side exploits serving campaigns throughout 2013, until Paunch - the kit's author - and his gang got arrested, leading to an evident decline in malicious Web activity, which was once attributed to the sophistication and systematic updates pushed to the kit's customers.
0.7415553295772 The samples I have are being spread not via Facebook but via Blackhole exploit kit, which is a very effective method.
0.1113314865583940 The script opens an IFRAME to a malicious site, which in turn launches a BlackHole exploit "pack" that probes for known browser and plugin weaknesses and then stealthily installs malware on the visitor's PC.
0.79043755944876 The second piece of malware installed by the BlackHole Exploit Pack is designed to steal sensitive user data, such as FTP passwords.
0.1621979528967003 The security community has been focused on the new Java zero-day exploits that appear to have been taken from a Chinese exploit pack (known as Gondad or KaiXin ) used in targeted attacks by the "Nitro" cyber-espionage campaign and then incorporated into criminal operations using the BlackHole Exploit Kit.
0.0939333053568062 The site, which posts a wide range of open source intelligence and leaked documents, was compromised on February 8 and had its entire contents modified to install the Blackhole exploit kit.
0.633164066119051 The statement didn't name Paunch or anyone else by name or handle, but it did say the group was connected to BlackHole.
0.567086380275798 | The threat is a highly advanced and stealthy backdoor being used to drive traffic to malicious websites carrying Blackhole exploit packs.
0.4425731183846247 The Trojan has been named the Blackhole RAT (for Remote Access Trojan), and according to Sophos researchers, the backdoor is not yet completely written.
0.376989788773123 The various spam campaigns leading to Blackhole.
0.1706617007395634 The vulnerability affects both Reader X and its recently introduced successor, Reader XI. And it's already incorporated into a custom version of the Blackhole Exploit Kit according to Krebs.
0.0708280167855502 The widespread availability of Java exploits in exploit kits such as Blackhole and Cool makes the threat more ominous, as that gives even unskilled attackers the ability to target large numbers or victims.
0.530951352291930 The winning factors for the success of Blackhole exploit kit are its efficiency, the availability of various models for sale (e.g. Sale, rent), the availability of frequent updates and a moderate price (Blackhole can be rented for as little as $200 to $300 per week).
0.653932586394070 There does not appear to be anything particularly new being served up at these Blackhole servers, they are serving up the usual array of exploits targeting known vulnerabilities in Java, Flash and Adobe PDF Reader.
0.700250366587891 There is a newly identified ongoing attack campaign in which attackers are using compromised Apache HTTP binaries to redirect users to malicious sites serving various flavors of malware, including the Blackhole exploit kit .
0.2989070886032487 These exploits lead to landing page hosting the Black Hole exploit kit and the amsecure attacks.
0.77335959059201 These URLs, if confirmed as BlackHole, show a clear deviation from the conventional URI patterns employed by the toolkit.
0.1150116077196763 This behavior indicates that the attacker used the Blackhole Exploit Kit in these attacks.
0.521475371734640 This Darkleech exploit (aka Linux.Cdorked) injects malicious redirections into a website that leads to a Blackhole exploit kit (BEK) landing page.
0.5648641619359 This gives attackers a new and stealthy launchpad for client-side attacks included in Blackhole , a popular toolkit in the underground that exploits security bugs in Oracle's Java, Adobe's Flash and Reader, and dozens of other programs used by end users.
0.2158667736166399 This is based on the fact that Blackhole Exploit Kit is already collecting stats for Win8 and mobile OSs.
0.1730737255875284 This is data collected for the year 2011 and you can already see that even though BlackHole is a leader, Incognito is soon catching up.
0.379284034940784 This is the primary difference between it and the Blackhole kit, which is something of an open book.
0.15044262070378 This tactic is reminiscent of Blackhole Exploit Kit 1.x versions, in which users are directed to compromised websites before the malicious landing page, in an attempt to avoid or at least, make detection difficult.
0.345207482395594 This week's episode of SpiderLabs Radio hosted by Space Rogue is brought to you by Trustwave SpiderLabs and features stories about Paunch Arrested, Blackhole not updated, Gonzi author freed, KDMS Team hits Avira, AVG and Metasploit, Whatsapp is theoretical, Microsoft gives out $100K, Google pays for open source, Million Mask March, Pwnsauce and Palladium get no jail, Brazil accuses Canada and more!

0.345391676486351 To start with, for those not familiar with the Blackhole exploit kit, let me start with a 5-point "cheat sheet" to get you up to speed:
0.2860504874256384 Together with the previous development of differing infection chains, this may represent an attempt to lower the profile of Blackhole attacks.
0.0807633618807571 True enough, we recently received reports of a Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) run that incorporated an exploit (detected by Trend Micro as JAVA_ARCAL.A ) targeting the recently patched CVE-2013-0431 .

0.655752181648427 We also partially delve into the history of exploit kits, including the notorious Blackhole exploit kit , which collapsed with the arrest of its author in late 2013.
0.3679460197254823 We cannot confirm whether these Javascript files resulted in redirects to landing sites that would lead to exploit kits, but the added content to the compromised sites we have seen is almost identical to that used by Blackhole campaigns.
0.534523882340887 We have been tracking several exploit kits that we have identified these past few months and it's interesting to see which gets the biggest chunk of the pie: 56% of the coverage is owned by only three exploit kits: Blackhole, Sweet Orange and Cool.

0.06078701484159121 Williams said that criminals will likely continue to package other exploit kits with BlackHole threats.
0.764551324835995 Wisniewski says Blackhole has basically been a victim of its own success.
0.305733978247852 With all these "differences", it appears that Cool and Blackhole are more than just a tiny bit related.
0.5895721727993 With other exploit kits already dominant in the market, a decline in Blackhole activity would not necessarily mean a change in the overall threat landscape.
0.55453568716331 With updates pushed out as often as twice per day, Blackhole was a moving target that often sidestepped security measures and succeeded in compromising numerous domains, turning them into traps for visitors.
0.599750035559237 Within 24 hours of that discovery, attack code exploiting the vulnerability was added to BlackHole , a hack-by-numbers exploitation kit sold in underground forums.
0.666866833759122 Without Blackhole in their back pockets, cybercriminals will have to do more grunt work to infect PCs.
0.680242466656594 According to Wisniewski at Sophos, "it took less than 12 hours from the time the proof of concept for the latest Java zero-day vulnerabilities went public for exploits of those vulnerabilities to be included in a commercial crimeware kit"--namely, the BlackHole toolkit.

0.070191628858491 In a press release detailing the investigation's findings, Dairy Queen included a list of the locations hit as well as the time periods that Backoff was present on their systems, which varied by location.
0.623249305030720 In this case, the attackers bruteforced remote access tools, including Remote Desktop and LogMeIn, and when they gained access, they deployed the malware. Like others, Backoff scraps the memory to extract track data (i.e. credit card information). Once hackers obtain that data, they filter that information to a remote server where they can then sell it on the black market.
0.267733441357102 International Dairy Queen Inc. has confirmed that systems in nearly 400 of its stores had been infected with Backoff, a malware that the company said is targeting retailers across the country.
0.751901031910154 The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US-CERT ), in collaboration with Trustwave SpiderLabs , FS-ISAC and the U.S. Secret Service , recently issued an alert warning of new malware called Backoff, which specifically targets point-of-sale (PoS) systems.
0.4886848525412673 We have been seeing attacks like this one on PoS systems over the past few years, said Jaime Blasco, labs director of security startup AlienVault, in a comment to Infosecurity. Again in this case, the attackers brute-forced remote access tools, including Remote Desktop and LogMeIn, and when they gained access, they deployed the malware. Like others, Backoff scraps the memory to extract track data (i.e. credit card information). Once hackers obtain that data, they filter that information to a remote server where they can then sell it on the black market.
0.639946604429287 2012 was a year full of major security incidents: Flame, Shamoon, Flashback, Wiper, Gauss, and so on.
0.641767129495755 3.1 Protection Layer The analyzed sample of Backoff is wrapped with a runtime packer to protect it from detection and analysis.
0.75594187298519 A new and more fine-tuned version of the Backoff point of sale malware known as ROM has been spotted in the wild, according to researchers.
0.639956966640174 A new breed of point-of-sale malware has been found in several recent attacks, and experts say that the tool, known as Backoff, has extensive data stealing and exfiltration capabilities, including keylogging, memory scraping and injection into running processes.
0.06243518211082843 A recent Kaspersky Lab research examination of two command and control servers used by the Backoff point-of-sale malware revealed that a U.S.-based Mexican restaurant chain, a North American freight shipping company and a North American payroll association had also been breached.
0.562699115854534 A security firm that worked with the government to identify point-of-sale (POS) malware, called "Backoff," has detected two new variants of the threat.
0.377153762135818 A similar advisory was issued by the FBI at the beginning of this year against other RAM-scraping malware variants, but despite those warnings, new research now shows that attackers are continuing to utilize Backoff to a devastating effect.

0.4786505670518508 This means of persistence is performed by a piece of code which Backoff injects to explorer.exe.
0.632417728798819 This version also does not have a version number, but has been given the name Backoff ROM.
0.4279539162840708 This will terminate the original Backoff process and delete the initial copy of itself.
0.4370888802587512 Though Dairy Queen has not clarified how the malware infiltrated its payment systems, the advisory noted at the time that the attackers spreading Backoff targeted the user credentials of employees that worked remotely, using remote desktop applications like Splashtop to install the malware on corporate systems.
0.1041370710729847 Threat expert demos the 'Backoff' POS malware.
0.201192868903794 To get an idea on the breadth and scale of this issue in the Retail sector, the Department of Homeland Security's US-CERT sent out an alert on July 31 st wide spread prevalence of one single malware variant used in POS machines - BackOff.
0.479355465314109 Trend Micro detects Backoff variants as TSPY_POSLOGR.A , TSPY_POSLOGR.B , and TSPY_POSLOGR.C .
0.420203302885350 Uncovered in late July, Backoff scrapes memory from running processes on targeted devices, and has therefore been planted on retailers' POS systems by criminals desiring to pilfer consumer card data.
0.712981527848508 "Uninstall" a. Removes all files associated with Backoff.
0.175937370592927 Up until now, the BackOff family was thought to be among the most prolific and sophisticated - hitting big name brands including Dairy Queen and UPS.
0.490836064358711 UPS, however, has not yet confirmed that the malware used in the attack, which affected 51 of its stores, was, in fact, Backoff.
0.745906927130499 UPS says it began auditing all POS systems at UPS Stores for malware infections after receiving a July 31 government alert about a rise in POS malware attacks , including a number of Backoff variants designed to infect POS systems and steal credit and debit card data when cards are swiped.
0.559532482779644 U.S. Department of Homeland Security July 31 advisory warned that more than 1,000 businesses had been hit by Backoff
0.719007988036815 US-CERT found that Backoff in general has four capabilities: Scraping memory for track data; logging keystrokes; command & control (C2) communication; and injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe, which is responsible for persistence in the event the malicious executable crashes or is forcefully stopped.
0.412038919853858 US-CERT has updated its alert to advise businesses on ways to mitigate Backoff.
0.4481168003662253 US-CERT is warning of a fresh malware dubbed Backoff
0.4505529331477452 US-CERT is warning of a fresh malware dubbed Backoff, associated with several point of sale (PoS) data breach investigations.
0.2897202347423465 We analyzed Backoff and discovered that it has multiple versions, ranging from 1.4 to 1.55.
0.635789608200009 "We have been seeing attacks like this one on PoS systems over the past few years," said Jaime Blasco, labs director of security startup AlienVault, in a comment to Infosecurity. "Again in this case, the attackers brute-forced remote access tools, including Remote Desktop and LogMeIn, and when they gained access, they deployed the malware. Like others, Backoff scraps the memory to extract track data (i.e. credit card information). Once hackers obtain that data, they filter that information to a remote server where they can then sell it on the black market."
0.3485093728937136 We ran BackOff with Invincea's Freespace to understand how BackOff behaves on an infected system.
0.256405312279819 What is concerning form the table is the fact that there are only 8/8 submissions of BACKOFF in the last two months in VirusTotal, while we have been seeing a significant increase in breach reporting (see Figure 23).
0.102123429351229 While details of the breach are not known, some security experts have already spotlighted the Backoff point-of-sale (POS) malware as a likely tool used in the attack.
0.48572607652456 While some security researchers predicted that Backoff was the likely culprit in the Home Depot breach, unnamed investigators reportedly named a different malicious program, BlackPOS, as the attack tool.
0.627783216944324 Zaichkowsky pointed to Backoff, or a similar memory-scraping point-of-sale infector, as a likely culprit as well.

0.67365738312560 We don't know for sure - perhaps the the two groups are joining forces, or perhaps the Necurs source code has been acquired by the Gameover gang.
0.4786257429831740 "A lot of time researchers will classify a certain piece of malware and say 'We've got it!' and file it off in a shelf and not really study it," he says. "That kind of approach wouldn't really have worked with NotCompatible. A researcher may have written it off when they first discovered it because it was just a proxy server and didn't seem to be doing that much damage. But studying it for years showed how sophisticated this network did become."
0.0679589732191395 A new threat in the second quarter, dubbed NotCompatible after one of the C2 domains, acts as a proxy that gives the attacker access to networks accessible by the mobile device.
0.0875947300874895 According to Linden, the rise in NotCompatible is a good lesson that security researchers should pay more attention to mobile threats over longer periods of time.
0.522847745217812 Additionally, NotCompatible utilizes peer-to-peer communication between the nodes for added resiliency.

0.4221937594010777 As we see in the preceding images, NotCompatible will automatically start at boot.
0.2524047652488692 "Based on our current research, NotCompatible is a new Android trojan that appears to serve as a simple TCP relay/proxy while posing as a system update," the advisory stated.
0.634017296335723 Based on our previous analysis, we conclude that NotCompatible is an unusual Android malware delivered to users using a drive-by attack that could represent a proof of concept for a targeted attack.
0.255535952020251 Based on some Googling, this appears to be the malware usually called "NotCompatible" and which comes in a file named update.apk.
0.3798244526752253 Beyond NotCompatible, the report found TowelRoot and TowelExploit, root exploit malware, and BasicSystemSpy, a surveillance malware, to be the most pressing concern to U.S. enterprises.
0.2552949406947484 Details of the malware - dubbed NotCompatible.C - were published by Lookout in a report released today.
0.582195872000117 In addition, NotCompatible.C's traffic is encrypted, meaning that any enterprise or network-based security system can't block C&C traffic, and can't identify it because it's encrypted.
0.745320745971256 Lookout's Kevin Mahaffey told Infosecurity that early iterations of the NotCompatible threat emerged in 2012, distributed via hacked websites or spam campaigns that turned mobile devices into a proxy, allowing hackers to bounce traffic through them.
0.513877383989386 Mobile security firm Lookout has discovered a more sophisticated variant of the NotCompatible Android botnet which it says targets enterprise networks through compromised mobile devices.
0.0559682436233555 Most threatening to enterprises was the "NotCompatible" trojan, which could allow attackers to compromise secure corporate networks.
0.730382242579669 NotCompatible uses the New I/O Proxy API implementation, which is a low-level API that provides access to intensive input/output operations.
0.611964792490634 NotCompatible.C works by giving attackers access to any network a compromised device is connected to, including corporate Wi-Fi and VPNs.
0.3206337257309157 That's not anything new, but what makes this threat different is the level of sophistication in the backend of NotCompatible to resist reverse engineering and takedown efforts by the security community.
0.0668361941548355 The malware, dubbed NotCompatible, is being transmitted by websites when they're accessed on smartphones running Google's Android operating system.

0.371259206877656 [1] We uncovered a bug that impacts all Linux platforms, including mobile devices, and we're calling it "grinch."
0.3178886405082660 Alert Logic claimed that an attacker could exploit grinch through the use of a third-party Linux software framework called Policy Kit (Polkit), which was designed to aid users in installing and running software packages.
0.540656031756186 Bash related vulnerabilities like the Grinch, are primarily a problem to retailers and e-commerce platforms like Amazon, who tend to favor Unix/Linus based operating systems.
0.4864278935627840 But this is no Heartbleed or Shellshock moment: Grinch doesn't pose an imminent threat, security experts say, but it should serve as a wakeup call for how Linux systems are configured.
0.505626330335246 Grinch is not remotely exploitable; it requires that an attacker have physical access the server they want to attack.
0.2023973331790350 Grinch technically resides in the new Linux authorization system that allows privilege escalation through Wheel, the firm revealed in its blog.
0.584325862968937 In an interview with SCMagazine.com, Stephen Coty, director of threat research at Alert Logic, said that, simply put, "anything that is set up by the Linux default settings would be affected" by grinch.
0.538199732715980 In other words, grinch doesn't have the wide attack surface of Shellshock , which relied on the Bash shell found in nearly all Linux distributions.
0.1843999823740365 More importantly, understanding how your Linux system work will go a long way in tackling a bug like Grinch.
0.1365303197758059 Other security experts have also downplayed grinch.
0.4548688341051354 Security researchers uncover 'grinch' vulnerability that could affect all Linux systems.
0.177553556970329 Some smartphone running on Linux related OS could also be vulnerable to the Grinch bug.
0.677985043226186 The Grinch vulnerability, affecting all Linux based operating system potentially gives an attacker root access to a system according to Alert Logic who announced the Bug on Tuesday.
0.757153553236292 We dove further into the Linux platform and discovered grinch, which exists in the new authorization system that allows privilege escalation through wheel.
0.770423433401078 "We find that possession of user logs and knowledge of your own environment are the best security content to help you navigate away from a bug like grinch.

0.0973134409314996 Millions of PCs sickened by a global computer contagion known as DNSChanger were slated to have their life support yanked on March 8.
0.0666250162150765 "Months-long efforts to eradicate the DNSChanger "clickjacking" trojan were deemed a success after the FBI on July 9 disconnected infected machines from substitute servers that were being used to allow them to maintain internet connectivity.
0.770157633362362 More than 300,000 PCs remain infected , long after the FBI caught the bad guys and took control of the servers behind DNSChanger.
0.3739299555268831 Not only does DNSChanger redirect Internet connections, it also disables anti-virus software, opening individuals and organizations up for more malicious attacks.
0.351533397928154 Of course, I like recommending our scanners (just visit http: //www.kaspersky.com ) because I have cleaned up DNSChanger infected systems with it (and the products have fully functional trial periods), along with our TDSSKiller rootkit removal tool to clean up especially complex DNSChanger infections.
0.629706383854629 On July 9, 2012, any systems still infected with the DNSChanger Trojan will be summarily disconnected from the rest of the Internet, and the latest reports indicate this malware is still resident on systems at 12 percent of Fortune 500 companies, and roughly four percent of U.S. federal agencies.
0.632298991820458 One suggested solution is to download AV software that scans for DNSChanger, rather than rely solely on one of sites on the FBI's Check-up List .
0.0973608866543738 Other resources for cleaning up DNSChanger infections are here .
0.1660897430110046 Rasmussen said there are still millions of PCs infected with DNSChanger.
0.3140653389911267 Should the FBI be reauthorized to continue DNSChanger servers?
0.3128334415478576 So the picture is much more crowded than just the DNSChanger malware and the bogus Rove Digital DNS servers.
0.1937734816148618 Some of the same people who were pointing out that DNSChanger only affected a drop in the huge Internet bucket were now informing all users everywhere of a huge security problem.
0.4899213038078832 Starting today we're undertaking an effort to notify roughly half a million people whose computers or home routers are infected with a well-publicized form of malware known as DNSChanger.
0.085836316925149 That's in spite of public pleas for businesses and other computer users to take steps to ensure they won't suffer an Internet outage when the FBI shuts down the DNSChanger servers July 9.
0.3462887372635524 The author of Trend DNSChanger Bot claims his malware includes the best of its predecessor - including a powerful rootkit designed to make the code difficult to detect and remove - as well as the blocking of any Internet traffic between the host machine and antivirus and security vendors.
0.2644473393397319 The cybercriminals who developed the DNSChanger Trojan did so to redirect infected users to websites where the cybercriminals profited off of advertisements and even scams in some cases.But how does the DNSChanger Trojan work?
0.2378366356703395 The DNSChanger botnet, which hooked into infected systems quite deeply and spread to both Windows and Mac computers, was eradicated only by a worldwide, concerted digital quarantine and vaccination effort - combined with the arrest of its creators .
0.596414568477007 The DNSChanger Working Group, a public-private industry consortium, reports that there are around 60,000 systems located within the U.S. that are still pointing to the Rove Digital DNS servers - down from 500,000 in November.
0.502415687432629 The family of DNS changing malware includes binaries identified as OSX/Jahlav, OSX/DNSchanger, OSX/Puper, OSX/RSPlug (and sundry variations according to individual vendor naming conventions).
0.2041679982339159 The findings come ahead of the July 9th deadline, where the FBI will shut down servers that have allowed users whose computers are infected with DNSChanger malware to navigate the Internet.
0.216534365925589 The latest DNSChanger deadline is rapidly approaching: July 9th .
0.3794721671554530 The latest stats from the DNSChanger Working Group , an industry consortium working to eradicate the malware, more than 300,000 systems are still infected.
0.166616260797700 The maker of Trend DNSChanger bot says his malware will invoke messaging from the victim's own Internet service provider, warning of illicit activity and demanding fines for alleged infractions of the ISP's terms of service.
0.443356826874683 The malware, known as the " DNSChanger Trojan ," quietly alters the host computer's Internet settings to hijack search results and to block victims from visiting security sites that might help scrub the infections.
0.1937400204497977 The predicament comes after federal prosecutors arrested six of the seven people alleged to be behind the DNSChanger scam.
0.657152685254789 The US government had kept hundreds of thousands of Internet users infected with DNSChanger online.
0.788681812401410 The U.S. government has requested a three-month extension for the operation of temporary DNS servers to give computer users more time to identify and purge the DNSChanger trojan from their systems.
0.2345919467885012 There are a set of sites that may unreliably help you identify whether your machine or router continues to maintain DNS settings to the "DNSChanger" operators' servers.
0.346287278211889 These findings come less than two weeks before the July 9 deadline that requires the FBI to take down the temporary servers that enable millions of computers and routers infected with DNSChanger to still reach their intended Internet destinations.
0.2435503871509403 This new version, dubbed Trend DNSChanger Bot , also hijacks the host machine's DNS settings but with the purpose of extracting a ransomware payment from the victim.
0.4619175064733892 This situation could become a reality for you on July 9th when the FBI shuts down the servers responsible for the DNSChanger Trojan and, if infected, you will lose the ability to use the Internet.
0.562094749537271 This works properly billions of times a day, but there are ways for attackers to mess with the system, as the DNSChanger crew did, and route your DNS requests through a name server that they control.
0.462167836228803 To illustrate just how pervasive and problematic DNSChanger has been since being discovered in late 2005, IID has designed the first infographic (click above for large version) detailing this malware infection.
0.542925534962674 To prevent millions of Internet users infected with the DNSChanger malware from losing Internet connectivity when the members of the ring where arrested, the FBI replaced rogue DNS servers with clean servers.
0.776189296046898 Tom Grasso Jr. , an FBI supervisory agent at the National Cyber Forensics & Training Alliance in Pittsburgh, Pa., said the DNSChanger Working Group - the industry and law enforcement coalition that's handling the remediation - has been discussing what to do about the upcoming deadline, but he declined to offer specifics.
0.799806079151020 Trend Micro senior threat researcher Feike Hacquebord believes that it may take some time to completely recover from the effects of the DNSChanger, "Rove Digital has been spreading DNS Changer Trojans and other malware for many years.
0.678288511344639 UPDATE : On March 5, 2012, a federal judge agreed to allow more time for organizations and individuals to clean systems of the DNSChanger malware and extended the deadline for shutting off servers that had been keeping infected computers connected to the internet.

0.584459112318789 iOS Masque Attack revived: Bypassing Prompt for Trust and App URL scheme hijacking.
0.588801508562234 Perhaps what makes Masque Attack more of a real threat is that enterprise provisioning is currently being used by third-party app sites, especially those based in China.
0.284917544259674 Researchers at network threat prevention company FireEye have uncovered a revived iOS Masque Attack, a vulnerability that originally surfaced in November 2014.
0.560097727522765 Security researchers found that the Masque attack works on Apple's mobile operating system including iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and the 8.1.1 beta version and that all of the iPhones and iPads running iOS 7 or later, regardless of whether or not the device is jailbroken are at risk.
0.596241006373425 The first Masque Attack, uncovered in November , allowed miscreants to steal user data from app caches, but FireEye explains that Masque Attack II give hackers the means to bypass the iOS prompt for trust and carry out app URL scheme hijacking which could lead to phishing attacks, a Thursday blog post explained.
0.2028288194424471 The "Masque Attack" exploits a system Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through the App Store, David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout, tells Reuters .
0.56914507564678 Unlike the first variation of the Masque attack, this iteration includes iOS URL scheme hijacking, which allows it to be propagated directly through the App Store.
0.422593588914235 Using the "Masque Attack," an attacker can replace authentic apps, such as banking and e-mail applications, using malware through the Internet, FireEye says.
0.459215148112155 We describe these two parts of Masque Attack II in the following sections.
0.388886878405507 While they seem to have successfully deflected responsibility for the Celebgate celebrity photo leak by blaming their users (who could expect Apple to block an attack using methods from a decade ago?), now hackers have outsmarted Apple again with the Masque Attack which allows hackers to bypass iOS security protections against malicious apps simply by giving their malware the same name as an already approved safe application.

0.3199869656001913 All told, around 2 million PCs were infected with the MyDoom virus, especially since the malware used the contact list to expand its reach to the victim's family, friends and colleagues.
0.54305067461748 At its peak, MyDoom reached an infection rate of 1 in every 12 e-mails.
0.1197935626238014 But then commonly discovered examples of Windows malware encountered at the time either, like the MyDoom or Sobig, also required manual intervention (the user clicking on a file attachment).
0.362201161938484 For example, the Mydoom worm spreads via an email attachment which, if opened, creates a backdoor on port 3127 to allow remote control of the infected PC.
0.736829974302545 "MyDoom contained the text 'andy; I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry,' which led many to believe that the virus was constructed for a fee for a spammer, though this also was not confirmed," Menegaz wrote.
0.288259643812730 Mydoom executed Distributed Denial-of-Service attack on one particular website and opened a backdoor on infected computers, which left the machine open to remote access.

0.2006122159194423 Now researchers have identified a new variant of the Cridex malware that has adopted some of the techniques that made GOZ so successful in its day.
0.627219673919928 Raff said it is unclear where the credentials used in the new campaign came from, though it is likely they were stolen during attacks using the older Cridex version.
0.4962709639805593 There is no definitive information on where the 50,000 stolen credentials came from, but Cridex is the suspected culprit, he said.
0.599131845344204 9FB4DD1B3E0B Malwarebytes : Trojan.Agent.ED Ikarus : Worm.Win32.Cridex Fortinet : W32/Kryptik.ASU!
0.457043917215155 A variant of the Cridex malware, called Geodo, steals data from compromised machines and comes with a self-replicating feature built from a list of 50,000 stolen SMTP credentials.
0.0646944156429234 Another difference between the two is that Cridex is usually spread with the help of exploit kits.
0.734979451926435 But the HTML injections and scripts as well as the structure of the attack used by Bugat to target banking applications are what IBM calls "GOZ-like"-and therefore very dangerous.
0.1183927675563635 Cridex traditionally had been known to spread via removable drives, but newer versions of the malware began arriving via Blackhole exploit kits, according to Trend Micro.

0.576306282739950 Geodo, a new version of the infamous Cridex (also known as Feodo or Bugat) banking information stealing Trojan works in conjunction with a worm that sends out emails automatically to continue its self-spreading infection method,
0.424591918743159 He added, "The second and more likely explanation is that the Bugat team could have analyzed and perhaps reversed the GOZ malware before copying the HTML injections that made GOZ so highly profitable for its operators.".
0.763074051498657 If you aren't careful about keeping your software and OS updates, chances are that the exploit kit will find a security vulnerability to take advantage of and will download and execute the Cridex Trojan - a piece of banking malware that also opens a backdoor on the target computer.

0.153246348556442 Now, researchers at IBM's X-Force research team have seen a new version of Cridex, which is also known as Bugat and Feodo, using some of the same techniques that GOZ used to such good effect.
0.31094668208064 Recent efforts by our Research Lab has revealed new activity related to Cridex.
0.270593651538647 The use of macros is a marked departure from CRIDEX's infection chain, which relies on the Blackhole Exploit Kit.

0.716267167777843 As compared to CryptoLocker , for example, getting a sample of CoinVault requires passing through multiple security layers and dealing with string keys and byte arrays to eventually get to the malicious payload.
0.1200659747748965 CoinVault doesn't vary much from traditional attacks in that it requests victims use bitcoins to recover their files, and if no payment is received within 24 hours, the ransom increases.
0.792633638368244 CoinVault, or TROJ_CRYPTCOIN.AK stands out from other variants because it offers users a rare opportunity: the chance to save one encrypted file.
0.2420327308169122 CryptoLocker , CoinVault , and TeslaCrypt are the names of some of the most dreaded ransomware that infected million of users worldwide.
0.1587121178838024 Even though the cybercriminals packaged CoinVault with this "freebie" offer, it's still best to take preventive measures against threats that hold your files for ransom.
0.658532585409897 Kaspersky Lab, in cooperation with the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands and the Netherlands National Prosecutors Office, recently made available tool that helps recover files lost to the CoinVault ransomware .
0.537748725749249 Kaspersky, which teamed up with Dutch law enforcement authorities in the CoinVault attacks, obtained access to the private keys from the attackers and offers CoinVault victims who are locked out of their data access to their confiscated key.
0.580286626869918 Now, however, a newly identified ransomware, 'CoinVault,' is changing up these tactics by offering victims a "free decrypt," possibly to show good faith on the attackers' side, according to a SecureList blog post .
0.558855847257479 The Smart Protection Network\u2122 protects users against CoinVault and CRYPAURA malware by blocking all files and malicious URLs related to this threat.
0.1638241008624372 These include instructions and removal tools to get rid of FBIRansomWare and Coinvault ransomware, as well Trend Micro's ransomware removal tool and instructions on how to use it.
0.251956075701323 This freemium model was seen in the malware CoinVault , but this CTB Locker variant upped the ante by allowing the victim to choose five files, rather than just one, to be decrypted.
0.3240012030915021 A new breed of ransomware called TorrentLocker that mimics more feared versions like CryptoLocker and CryptoWall has been discovered targeting users in Australia.
0.55765508732601 As far as i know, Teerac.A (Microsoft's name) aka Torrent Locker was using a "CryptoLocker" identity :
0.473038235318943 CryptoLocker copycat, TorrentLocker, discovered by researchers.
0.407065606609179 It's called Crypt0L0cker - the letter "o" has been replaced by zeroes - and, despite the name, the malware has much more in common with TorrentLocker that CryptoLocker .
0.3422409995119455 Security experts from iSIGHT Partners have detected a new piece of PC ransomware they dubbed TorrentLocker, and say that it is an entirely new strain that imitates both CryptoLocker and CryptoWall .
0.1603088777336776 "TorrentLocker is a new strain of ransom malware that appears to use components of CryptoLocker and CryptoWall, but the code is completely different from the other two ransomware families.
0.542838470407501 TorrentLocker is nowhere near as widespread a threat as CryptoLocker or CryptoWall, and researchers don't expect that to change much.
0.601039129954252 TorrentLocker is similar to an earlier ransomware family ( CryptoLocker ), and also encrypts various files and forces users to pay a sum of money.
0.09215569377235 TorrentLocker ransom note that uses CryptoLocker branding.
0.3398503633844166 Variants such as CryptoLocker and CryptoWall have been siphoning money from victims for some time, and now researchers have dissected a newer variant known as TorrentLocker and found that the creators made a key mistake that enables them to recover encrypted files in some circumstances.
0.512484434415535 Cybercriminals have pocketed substantial payments from victims infected by TeslaCrypt , a relatively new ransomware threat known for being distributed through the Angler Exploit Kit (EK).
0.662776178145462 Despite the snappy name, the similarity between the original CryptoLocker and TeslaCrypt is negligible (approximately 8%), researchers explained: "So it would seem the attackers are just re-using the brand.".
0.252939671675849 In the first quarter of 2015, McAfee Labs registered a 165% increase in new ransomware driven largely by the new, hard-to-detect CTB-Locker ransomware family, new ransomware families such as Teslacrypt and TOX , and the emergence of new versions of CryptoWall, TorrentLocker, and BandarChor.
0.2418856663803419 TeslaCrypt is a CryptoLocker variant that specifically targets gamers , but that scope could be soon expanding with some researchers noting that exploit kits including Nuclear, Sweet Orange and Angler, have been dropping TeslaCrypt.
0.207871358997550 TeslaCrypt was discovered at the end of February, researchers at Bromium that analyzed the malicious code have discovered that it was distributed through a compromised WordPress website set up to redirect visitors to a page hosting the Angler exploit kit .
0.2299288850110157 The Teslacrypt ransom note (top) is similar to CryptoLocker's (bottom).
0.560563709365489 Crowti is also using digitally signed malware.
0.521545156642727 Cryptowall (Crowti) usually ends up on a victim's machine in one of these three ways: This latest malware delivery campaign makes use of previously installed malware and exploit kits to download the ransomware and run it.
0.735547969014596 Like CryptoWall and its variants, Crowti eventually directs its victims to a Tor page and gives them instructions on how to purchase Bitcoin to unlock their information.
0.3949653254078281 Researchers have also seen Crowti propagating via popular exploit kits like Nuclear , RIG and RedKit V2, exploiting old and out-of-date versions of Adobe Flash and Oracle Java.
0.4315703993236077 The infamous Crowti ransomware often dubbed Cryptowall is back with a new campaign, this time using the I2P anonymity network to communicate with its command and control infrastructure.
0.2627817278555417 The Microsoft Malware Protection Center's Marianne Mallen said Redmond had seen a sudden spike from no infections on 11 January to 288 the following day, after an almost two month hiatus for Crowti.
0.763728859210856 While Crowti shares several traits with other types of ransomware, it's even borrowing their names as well.
0.707523022940809 The Point-of-Sale malware, dubbed " PoSeidon ", is designed in a way that it has the capabilities of both the infamous Zeus banking Trojan and BlackPOS malware which robbed Millions from US giant retailers, Target in 2013 and Home Depot in 2014.
0.795110922320894 Backoff is just another piece of point-of-sale (POS) malware, explained Jaime Blasco, labs director of security startup AlienVault.
0.1508863265214813 In a press release detailing the investigation's findings, Dairy Queen included a list of the locations hit as well as the time periods that Backoff was present on their systems, which varied by location.
0.1744121121336412 International Dairy Queen Inc. has confirmed that systems in nearly 400 of its stores had been infected with Backoff, a malware that the company said is targeting retailers across the country.
0.779933085276812 The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US-CERT ), in collaboration with Trustwave SpiderLabs , FS-ISAC and the U.S. Secret Service , recently issued an alert warning of new malware called Backoff, which specifically targets point-of-sale (PoS) systems.
0.3822093732401219 We have been seeing attacks like this one on PoS systems over the past few years, said Jaime Blasco, labs director of security startup AlienVault, in a comment to Infosecurity. Again in this case, the attackers brute-forced remote access tools, including Remote Desktop and LogMeIn, and when they gained access, they deployed the malware. Like others, Backoff scraps the memory to extract track data (i.e. credit card information). Once hackers obtain that data, they filter that information to a remote server where they can then sell it on the black market.
0.654290257794511 3.1 Protection Layer The analyzed sample of Backoff is wrapped with a runtime packer to protect it from detection and analysis.

0.2239771935652862 A few months have passed since the release of the "Backoff" point-of-sale (PoS) malware advisory , but Backoff and other PoS malware continue to be an active threat as businesses keep reporting data breaches and the compromise of their customers' financial information.
0.73605595959713 A new and more fine-tuned version of the Backoff point of sale malware known as ROM has been spotted in the wild, according to researchers.
0.150181166747592 A new breed of point-of-sale malware has been found in several recent attacks, and experts say that the tool, known as Backoff, has extensive data stealing and exfiltration capabilities, including keylogging, memory scraping and injection into running processes.
0.0747402149757163 A similar advisory was issued by the FBI at the beginning of this year against other RAM-scraping malware variants, but despite those warnings, new research now shows that attackers are continuing to utilize Backoff to a devastating effect.
0.1063300440717446 A U.S. Department of Homeland Security July 31 advisory warned that more than 1,000 businesses had been hit by Backoff.
0.151706465053899 According to Fortinet's Chan, the latest variant of Backoff, dubbed "ROM" (and detected as W32/Backoff.B!
0.0832221826978580 According to the report, Backoff infections grew 57 percent from August to September and 27 percent during the month of September.
0.3974107359757832 According to the US-CERT advisory, the group behind the Backoff malware operation scanned the Internet to find potential victims by detecting installations of the remote-desktop software frequently used by service providers to manage the point-of-sale systems of their retail clients.
0.4834303676488720 Also, unlike previous Backoff versions, ROM doesn't disguise itself as a Java component, but instead, a media player under the name mplaterc.exe.
0.4008069997511981 Among the latest news items, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council issued a bulletin advising retailers to review security controls to ensure protection against Backoff malware , and Krebs on Security reported a possible Dairy Queen breach at a number of stores in several states.

0.551513314167454 "Backoff shows that businesses haven't learned the lesson yet," Blasco said. "The lessons to learn from the latest retailer breaches are: don't expose critical systems such as PoS devices to the Internet, especially if you are running Remote Desktop or similar. If for some reason you have to do it, try to create access lists so that only certain IP addresses can access those devices and use strong passwords or even two-factor authentication.

0.2967081989184575 Hong Kei Chan, a junior antivirus analyst with the firm said that like Backoff, ROM can extract Track 1 and Track 2 data from PoS terminals, and that it has a sophisticated approach when it comes to parsing that information.
0.739675464761533 How can companies protect against Backoff malware?
0.4274176809287446 If that's true, it wouldn't come as a huge surprise, given that some noted security experts believe the Backoff victim count will far exceed the initial estimate of 1000, and could even climb over 10,000 when the dust finally settles.
0.1787242312121143 In a press release detailing the investigation's findings, Dairy Queen included a list of the locations hit as well as the time periods that Backoff was present on their systems, which varied by location.
0.2709461508733670 In August 2014, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert about Backoff, warning that commonly used remote desktop applications, such as Apple Remote Desktop, Chrome Remote Desktop, LogMeIn, Join.me, Microsoft's Remote Desktop, Pulseway and Splashtop 2, may have been compromised by attackers (see 1,000 Businesses Hit By POS Malware ).
0.287211565720852 In comparison to other families of PoS malware, Backoff's custom algorithm is more sophisticated and has a number of sanity checks.
0.584631338783196 In incidents linked to Backoff, compromise of remote-access portals allowed attackers to install the memory-scraping malware directly to merchants' payment terminals.
0.700546335856366 In its alert, DHS said that Backoff has likely struck many more businesses which are still unaware of compromise.
0.1511808337038499 In just a few days, researchers identified over 100 victims - a number that represents fewer than 5% of the total number of Backoff C&C channels.
0.1561459850589835 In just two days, nearly 100 infected systems, mostly in the U.S. and Canada but also in a number of other countries, attempted to contact the servers which are now no longer controlled by Backoff's authors.
0.1720216280274153 In late August, researchers at Kaspersky Lab released data from two Backoff malware command and control servers that were sinkholed .

0.611359348120640 In recent years, U.S. retailers including Target , Home Depot and countless others have been subjected to massive data breaches largely due to a reliance on outdated payment processing systems that can be easily breached by RAM scraping malware like Backoff .
0.464112147169916 In the case of Backoff, the attacker simply had to take code and methods from earlier malware, add a few extra tweaks and put it to work.
0.26974796981450 In this blog post, we will describe the changes made in this newest version of the Backoff malware family.
0.3224755900108551 In this blog post, we will spare the details of explaining the entire mechanics of the memory-parsing process and just dive straight into Backoff's techniques for credit card extraction.
0.0730710080181700 In this section, we will discuss more about the unique features of Backoff's custom pattern matching algorithm.
0.548930955686183 In time I'm writing Fortinet announced to have found a newer version of Backoff on October 28th, 2014 that its researchers are currently analyzing.
0.571191247002267 Invincea's Belcher says Backoff doesn't behave much differently than other point-of-sale malware in that it scrapes payment card data from memory before it's encrypted on the device.
0.538258774827133 It does not install a service on the infected machine, but achieves persistence by creating a remote thread in explorer.exe which will restart Backoff if the malware stops running.
0.287618926365850 It is believed that Backoff may have been responsible for breaches impacting Target , as well as those more recently disclosed by UPS and SUPERVALU .
0.638319577451979 Josh Grunzweig, a malware research with Trustwave Spiderlabs, a contributor to the Department of Homeland Security report, said in a blog post that while none of Backoff's features should be consider "innovative," that doesn't mean it should be ignored.
0.0991067592052893 Just last week, Dairy Queen admitted that the details of around 600,000 cards had been swiped by hackers using the Backoff malware.
0.1677254762355352 Just last week the restaurant chain Dairy Queen confirmed that nearly 400 of its stores were breached this summer via the Backoff malware and that customers' payment card numbers, expiration dates and customer names had been compromised.

0.4361898860060604 Kaspersky Labs is reporting that the number of victims infected by the notorious Backoff PoS malware could far exceed the approximately 1,000 estimated by officials from the US Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service.
0.525414809753928 Keeping up to date with current threats New malware families like Backoff present challenges for all defense mechanisms.
0.60724803348885 LAST was noted as injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe, so that Backoff could maintain persistence on affected devices if the executable crashes or is "forcefully stopped," Trustwave said at the time.
0.703959075724246 Less than a month after US-CERT warned businesses about a fresh malware dubbed Backoff, associated with several point of sale (PoS) data breach investigations, it turns out that the bug is much more pervasive than originally thought.
0.1444154724548910 Like others, Backoff scraps the memory to extract track data (i.e. credit card information).
0.572083768976291 McAfee provides generic coverage for both plain and encrypted variants of BackOff, respectively, as "BackOff!"
0.157500657027504 "Modifications have been made by the malware author for evading detection and hindering the analysis process," Hong Kei Chan of Fortinet says in a blog post. "During the installation phase, Backoff drops a copy of itself on the infected machine and creates a number of autorun registry entries to ensure persistence."
0.611644675199366 More proof, if any was needed, that data breaches are a huge concern to the retail industry came just a few days ago when Dairy Queen became the latest victim, confirming it has found malware known as Backoff on its PoS systems.
0.655863929546101 Nearly 600 U.S. businesses compromised by 'Backoff' POS malware.
0.561962886277862 New point-of-sale malware known as Backoff has been linked to numerous remote-access attacks, putting smaller merchants at greatest risk.
0.702624743209295 New version of Backoff detected, malware variant dubbed 'ROM'.
0.2665199156837977 On August 19, New Orleans-based restaurant Mizado Cocina confirmed that an investigation by a third-party forensics firm - spurred by customer reports of fraudulent card activity earlier in the summer - had uncovered a Backoff infection in its environment.
0.3142169372350830 On Monday, Karl Sigler, threat intelligence manager at Trustwave told SCMagazine.com that Backoff has grown to encompass variants similar to " LAST ," or version 1.56, the latest version of the threat.
0.2470350119334466 Point-of-sale (POS) malware rocketed in the third quarter, with Backoff infections spiking over 50% from August to September, as big name retailers were caught out time and again, according to Damballa.
0.053153974398446 Point-of-sale systems have been a juicy target for hackers; the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report repeatedly has warned small businesses to be vigilant about these types of attacks, and experts have warned about malware families such as Backoff and others that are essentially RAM scrapers, accessing sensitive data in memory.
0.635365158765367 RAM scraping point-of-sale malware has already been the subject of several U.S. government warnings to businesses this year, and the Backoff malware was speculated to have infected more than 1,000 businesses.
0.0949444386373604 Recently the chain of restaurants Dairy Queen announced in an official statement that Backoff infected POS systems at nearly 400 of its stores, but the diffusion of the malicious agent is significant as explained by the Experts at Kaspersky Lab the estimated that more than 1,000 infections were locates in the US.
0.4803410029987673 Report: Backoff malware infections spiked in recent months.
0.707708745264566 Researchers have discovered a new variant of point-of-sale malware Backoff, which has picked up a number of new tricks to make it harder for analysts to analyze and detect.
0.0495147117959187 Researchers have identified three primary variants to the "Backoff" malware including 1.4, 1.55 ("backoff", "goo", "MAY", "net"), and 1.56 ("LAST").
0.765345531131023 Researchers observe more than a hundred connections to 'Backoff' sinkhole.
0.739674242676762 Retail security is under the microscope this week, thanks to data breaches at United Parcel Service franchises (and possibly Dairy Queen franchises ), government warnings about the Backoff point-of-sale malware, and new research that shows persistent vulnerabilities in retail applications.
0.5465678389341 ROM performs very similarly to Backoff's previous versions, but modifications have been made to make analysis more difficult and to avoid detection.
0.1393826126747342 Secret Service estimates that 1,000 businesses have been affected by Backoff
0.54890991180672 Security experts at Damballa security firm detected a 57% increase in infections of the popular Backoff malware in the third quarter, the number of infections was jumped high from August to September and in this last month Backoff infections increased 27%.
0.769643079000387 Similarly, Dairy Queen has been hit with Backoff, which has been used in more than one instance , thus proving that nothing is holy to cybercriminals, not even the home of the beloved blizzard.
0.1145725032873564 Since keylogging is an "essential feature" of Backoff, however, researchers believe the malware author may "reintroduce" the capability in a later variant, he said.
0.285383040433594 So, in theory, Apple Pay users would not have been compromised by the Backoff malware.".
0.0998239910730899 So much so that in the last month the US government issued an advisory about the threat posed by the Backoff PoS malware.
0.3516378476313163 Speculation has it that the custom malware used in the breach could have been a variant of the Backoff point-of-sale malware .
0.654503350959097 Such techniques are a common threat to small retail businesses, according to Trustwave, who helped the government agencies in their analysis of and response to the 'Backoff' program.
0.784322909810990 The 1.55 build has multiple versions as well, differentiated by nicknames such as "backoff", "goo" and "MAY."
0.05529670982878720 The APT security firm's Q3 State of Infections report found that Backoff infections grew by 57% during August and another 27% during September.
0.1445250969917558 The Backoff campaign illustrates two key characteristics of today's cyber threat landscape: 1) bad actors are ruthlessly pragmatic, and will continue exploiting vulnerabilities until they're sealed shut; 2) many enterprises are already infected with malware - and yet have no idea - because their traditional security system hasn't sounded any alarm bells.
0.313279397634054 The Backoff malware has been one of the most pervasive strands of point-of-sale malware in recent times and the subject of multiple U.S. government advisories.
0.680432030746944 The major antivirus software vendors have already issued signatures for Backoff and its variants.
0.553824969984695 The malware's spread prompted a summer alert from the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) followed by an urgent request in August by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) for merchants to contact their AV provider to ensure their software detects Backoff.
0.0988483814231868 The new advisory said that seven PoS system vendors confirmed that multiple clients have been affected by Backoff, with the U.S. Secret Service estimating that over 1,000 businesses may ultimately be infected based on the agency's ongoing investigations.
0.1335388581951215 The PCI Security Standards Council has issued a bulletin offering insights for mitigating the Backoff POS malware threat (see: 1,000 Businesses Hit by POS Malware ).
0.209745231604807 The point-of-sale malware, known as 'Backoff', was the subject of another report released by DHS less than a month ago, though at the time, the campaign was only linked to three unnamed breach investigations since it was discovered in October 2013.
0.1433771495699425 The recent Secret Service bulletin doesn't name any of the impacted businesses, but does say that seven PoS system providers have confirmed that they have had "multiple clients" infected with the Backoff malware:
0.316492045316073 The rise of Backoff malware comes in the midst of several high-profile security breaches that affected national retailers like Home Depot , Target and others.
0.37437892159800 The Secret Service recently issued an advisory warning of Backoff, and reported that more than 1,000 businesses had likely been compromised.
0.4546224583174347 The situation is very worrying, law enforcement fears an explosion of the number of infections worldwide, the US Secret Service estimated that as many as 1,000 US businesses may be compromised by Backoff malware.
0.553471608827454 The success of Backoff paints a very bleak picture of the state of point-of-sale security.
0.2129022416449244 The third malware family of interest, Backoff, appears to have been widely used in a more general attack approach.
0.597493786706511 The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued a statement saying that the "Backoff" malware was rife in U.S. businesses, taking over administrator accounts and removing customer data from several hundreds of companies.
0.2460852648121246 The US Secret Service and the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team warned in July and August that more than 1,000 retail companies had been breached by a malicious program known as Backoff.
0.628089915374115 The variant LAST was noted as injecting malicious stub into explorer.exe, so that Backoff could maintain persistence on affected devices if the executable crashes or is "forcefully stopped," Trustwave revealed in an overview of the malware .
0.266649368032424 This blog has briefly outlined the installation and unique attributes of the latest version of the Backoff PoS malware.
0.4346488656481388 This means of persistence is performed by a piece of code which Backoff injects to explorer.exe.
0.581717073002333 This version also does not have a version number, but has been given the name Backoff ROM.
0.1149061901793849 This will terminate the original Backoff process and delete the initial copy of itself.
0.665907350287227 Though Dairy Queen has not clarified how the malware infiltrated its payment systems, the advisory noted at the time that the attackers spreading Backoff targeted the user credentials of employees that worked remotely, using remote desktop applications like Splashtop to install the malware on corporate systems.
0.4535540460359057 Threat expert demos the 'Backoff' POS malware.
0.3715331438536142 To date, DHS said that seven POS vendors had confirmed that they "had multiple clients affected" by Backoff.
0.3234215686243816 To date, federal investigators estimate more than 1,000 U.S. businesses have been compromised by Backoff, which typically infects POS systems through the exploit of credentials used to access remote-access management software.
0.261832476630387 To get an idea on the breadth and scale of this issue in the Retail sector, the Department of Homeland Security's US-CERT sent out an alert on July 31 st wide spread prevalence of one single malware variant used in POS machines - BackOff.
0.213915110503924 Trend Micro detects Backoff variants as TSPY_POSLOGR.A , TSPY_POSLOGR.B , and TSPY_POSLOGR.C .
0.599173041518818 Uncovered in late July, Backoff scrapes memory from running processes on targeted devices, and has therefore been planted on retailers' POS systems by criminals desiring to pilfer consumer card data.
0.1871084893794904 "Uninstall" a. Removes all files associated with Backoff.
0.1259183118214841 Up until now, the BackOff family was thought to be among the most prolific and sophisticated - hitting big name brands including Dairy Queen and UPS.
0.1160591983601807 UPS, however, has not yet confirmed that the malware used in the attack, which affected 51 of its stores, was, in fact, Backoff.
0.572483267544344 UPS says it began auditing all POS systems at UPS Stores for malware infections after receiving a July 31 government alert about a rise in POS malware attacks , including a number of Backoff variants designed to infect POS systems and steal credit and debit card data when cards are swiped.
0.774212340235322 UPS says it initiated an investigation into possible POS network intrusions after federal authorities issued an alert about emerging malware, including the new memory-scraping POS malware known as Backoff , which has been identified in a handful of recent forensics investigations tied to retail breaches.
0.767351677388481 U.S. businesses have had their systems infected by Backoff
0.739787981227715 U.S. Department of Homeland Security July 31 advisory warned that more than 1,000 businesses had been hit by Backoff
0.0648724004905949 US-CERT encourages administrators and operators of Point-of-Sale systems to review the Backoff malware alert to help determine if your network may be affected.
0.645890770736392 US-CERT is warning of a fresh malware dubbed Backoff
0.593747610823854 We ran BackOff with Invincea's Freespace to understand how BackOff behaves on an infected system.
0.605143178348164 What is concerning form the table is the fact that there are only 8/8 submissions of BACKOFF in the last two months in VirusTotal, while we have been seeing a significant increase in breach reporting (see Figure 23).
0.345087744948708 While some security researchers predicted that Backoff was the likely culprit in the Home Depot breach, unnamed investigators reportedly named a different malicious program, BlackPOS, as the attack tool.
0.523132309979867 The malware has been named 'DarkSeoul' and 'Jokra' by the community.
0.0729829096467916 And like DarkSeoul, the Destover wiper executables were compiled somewhere between 48 hours prior to the attack and the actual day of attack.
0.600767684543160 Destover used an internal webserver in the malware to display the message on the screen of affected PCs, just as DarkSeoul did, and the color schemes and themes of the messages displayed in both cases were the same.
0.450254332252117 Destover was detected several times in the last years, one of the most clamorous attacks is DarkSeoul run by Whois team that in 2013 targeted media and banking of the the South Korea, and the television networks YTN, MBC and KBS and Shinhan Bank and NongHyup Bank, two major banks of the country, suffered serious outage.
0.0754663131999119 It also revealed that the tools used in the Sony attack had similarities to those used in the DarkSeoul attacks against South Korean banks and media companies in 2013.
0.523479519726735 The "DarkSeoul" attack was never previously publicly attributed directly to North Korea by security professionals, though it was widely assumed that its Unit 121 hacking team was connected in some way.
0.669894592378263 The DarkSeoul attacks, examined in the Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report and a big focus for our researchers last year, are an example of this strategy.
0.577211498335683 The executables for both Destover and DarkSeoul were compiled between 24 and 48 hours before the attacks, Baumgartner said, making it likely that attackers had already gained access to their targets' networks.
0.4582620452799114 The newly identified DarkSeoul group is also responsible for a new wave of attacks that hit South Korea on Tuesday and were timed to coincide with the 63rd anniversary of the state of the Korean War.
0.0956971366922082 Thoughts on DarkSeoul: data sharing and targeted Attackers.
0.043525505969195 "We can now attribute multiple previous high-profile attacks to the DarkSeoul gang over the last 4 years against South Korea, in addition to yesterday's attack," Symantec researchers wrote in the Wednesday post.
0.711975750848348 Breaking it down simply, Oppenheim explained that the BLACKCOFFEE malware is programmed to reach out to a Microsoft TechNet page - attacker-created profile pages and forum threads, the report indicates - and look for a keyword string, which in this case is an encoded string between the terms "@Microsoft" and "Corporation.".
0.0821957747983784 FireEye has revealed that a China-based hacking group has been using Microsoft TechNet as a relay for C&C addresses for BlackCoffee malware, but experts tell us it's nothing novel.
0.4712475105083241 PCs infected by the group's BLACKCOFFEE malware are instructed to contact this domain and will then be sent on to the real C&C address for further instructions.
0.355397418918078 "The machines are still infected with the BLACKCOFFEE malware and we are hoping that working with Microsoft and other security vendors, along with this blog being released, we can help clean up these other systems.".
0.2065043901457638 "This way the machines with BLACKCOFFEE were communicating with our sinkhole machine and not communicating with the attacker machines," Oppenheim said.
0.384400197962256 The threat involves BLACKCOFFEE malware, which FireEye has monitored APT17 using since 2013.
0.450325069878479 A lot of malware impacts control systems, like Conficker or Slammer, said Joel Langill, security consultant and author of the SCADAhacker blog, referring to two computer worms that caused headaches for tens of thousands of people using Microsoft.
0.053359365027870 The next two years would see the Slammer and Blaster worms, even more damaging than the worms of 2001.
0.50501176311298 Unfortunately, he said, many in the transportation industry have forgotten the impact of the Slammer and Blaster worms around eight years ago. I am afraid we have seen that any industry can be a victim of attack, but the most likely sectors to be targeted include transportation, energy, finance, telecoms and military, he said.
0.23899775587798 A demo of an exploit for the hole at the Black Hat Briefings in the Summer of 2003 also raised the profile of the SQL vulnerability, but to no avail: few SQL Server users had applied the company's patch by the time January rolled around (Litchfield estimated fewer than 1 in 10 had been patched prior to the release of Slammer).
0.237998563881827 For Microsoft in 2003, Slammer was a reminder that the company still had a long way to go if it wanted to see its nascent Trustworthy Computing effort bear fruit.
0.562512663567132 If you sent precisely 1.0 billion SQL Slammer packets, you'll see the 1.0 billion count appear on the console - even though the precise number of events in the database will be considerably less.
0.559789819980318 Or the SQL Slammer worm that attacked Windows 2000 systems?
0.710808467135912 Slammer was the first of many such vulnerabilities, and it was the catalyst that pushed vendors to start offering regular security patches.
0.449201368542772 SQL Slammer was based on proof of concept code privately disclosed to the company by UK security researcher David Litchfield months before, and quickly patched by the company.
0.1560524143716832 SQL Slammer worm in 2003, leading to potential Distributed Denial of Service attacks
0.339784560947245 That sort of penetration was probably exceeded by various network worms of the early 2000s, such as CodeRed , Nimda and Slammer ; in the last few years, however, viruses of that replicative power just haven't been seen.
0.4711832605953081 These IRC Bots started to emerge as the next generation of malware after nifty worm breakouts like Blaster, Sasser and Slammer.
0.322211460491547 This includes the Hikiti malware family and other associated backdoor strains such as Mdmbot and Moudoor - itself derived from the notorious Gh0st RAT.
0.22310391397340 After its injected, the DLL file appears to help initiate Gh0st RAT, a well-known remote access tool.
0.590886551827059 Amnesty International's UK website served up Gh0st RAT for two days.
0.572938065729852 Backdoor.ADDNEW (DarkDDoser) and Gh0st, a match made in heaven?
0.628349015334307 Detekt scans computers for infection patterns associated with several families of remote access Trojans (RATs) including DarkComet RAT , XtremeRAT, BlackShades RAT , njRAT , FinFisher FinSpy, HackingTeam RCS, ShadowTech RAT and Gh0st RAT.
0.3655521541471090 ESET researchers identified a Gh0st RAT sample that, they said, had a low number of detections among their users.
0.482063004524634 For example, earlier variants of Moudoor kept Gh0st's ability to open a remote shell, but this capability has disappeared in the newer versions.
0.464948138800905 Gh0st RAT and, as the researchers , is often used in attacks targeting Tibetans, Uyghurs and other groups on the ASEAN
0.1213000367651182 Gh0st RAT is an off-the-shelf RAT that is used by a variety of threat actors.
0.2835962803031476 Gh0st RAT was already in circulation among other hackers before it was modified for use by the Hainan-based attack.
0.651944801867594 Given that the C&C infrastructure for the attack is located in the Hong Kong area, the use of Gh0st RAT, the use of a particular script kit for victim redirection, and the targets of interest, the researchers believe that the attack was likely orchestrated and carried out by the same threat actors that effected the Aurora and Ghostnet attack campaigns.
0.630992061687867 If the exploits were successful, it would install the Gh0st RAT on the targeted computer in order for the attackers to have control over it.
0.674087420944083 Instead, the document exploited CVE-2012-0158, which could allow Gh0st RAT to be installed.
0.637732449307675 Malicious Java code was planted on the site in a bid to push the Gh0st RAT Trojan onto vulnerable Windows machines.
0.782538485902359 Moudoor is a derivative of the famous Gh0st RAT (remote access tool) that spawned many derivatives over time.
0.71333860089344 Multiple publicly available RATs, including Gh0st, LS4Ghost (the Linux server for Gh0st), Carberp, and NetCommander.

0.421668377243394 The Gh0st RAT variant's executable was signed with a valid certificate from a Shenzhen, China-based technology company, fooling some users into thinking the download was legitimate.
0.261949242617627 The majority of Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) callback activities relates to APT tools of Chinese origin (89%), one of most used malware is the popular Gh0st RAT used many times against Chinese dissidents and oppositions.
0.457826907495395 The malware, called Olyx, was discovered in a package that also contained some Windows malware and researchers say that the Mac backdoor is remarkably similar to the Gh0st RAT that was used in the infamous Ghostnet attacks in 2009.
0.438181601705533 The threat actor responsible for Operation DeputyDog also used the "HTTPS" version of the Gh0st .

0.0845074680513100 "Organizations should educate their employees to follow best security practices, such as only using POS systems for what they are intended for and not to browse the web, check email, play video games, etc.," researchers from security firm Trustwave wrote last month in a blog post that advised organizations on how to protect their systems against a memory-scraping memory program called Punkey.
0.0484728884389562 Punkey has versions for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows-based PoS terminals and in addition to stealing payment card data while it's being processed, it also installs a keylogger to capture what employees type on such systems.
0.4499868091969305 Punkey, with an investigation by the U.S. Secret Service identifying evidence of compromised payment card information as well as more than 75 infected - and active - IP addresses linked to point-of-sale terminals running Windows systems
0.679704722739887 Regarding Punkey's impact, Sigler said that the joint investigation with law enforcement revealed that 75 unique POS terminals may be infected with the malware.
0.169641250434500 Security researchers from Trustwave now warn that during a recent investigation with the U.S. Secret Service, they've uncovered yet another RAM-scraping PoS threat they've named Punkey.
0.4635967675053549 "This gives Punkey the ability to run additional tools on the system such as executing additional reconnaissance tools or performing privilege escalation," the Trustwave researchers said in a blog post .
0.645012007087374 "This was the only definitive number we have, but it does not mean that Punkey was limited to these 75 infections.".
0.396562264376802 Trustwave's Merritt also wrote a decryption tool in Ruby (available on Github ) and created a Yara signature that detects all versions of Punkey that the firm observed.
0.3748092150276053 What's especially worrying about Punkey, notes Computer World , is that the program is able to download and execute other malicious files, including updates for itself.
0.2745661365918825 "While the two families of malware share some tactics, Punkey goes to greater lengths to hide in the system," Mador explained.

0.373452217306000 Here are my tips to avoid having your computer infected with Cryptowall, or any other ransomware:
0.635868022738055 However, as of this publication, CryptoWall is thought to be controlled and used by a single threat group.
0.717999252599849 However, with CryptoWall 3.0, the user's traffic is also passed through another anonymity network called I2P.
0.4190667078606520 If the check indicates that the parent process name is "perl.exe" or "python.exe", then the program runs the following endless loop and never runs the Cryptowall 3.0 code.
0.765050153397006 If the encrypted connection goes well, the communication with the Cryptowall Command & Control server will take places; otherwise the main thread sleeps for a random number of seconds and then retries with a new generated server name.
0.741264338516359 If you're "had", Cryptowall encrypts all the files that you possible could want to keep (images, documents, etc), and then asks for a 500$ ransom.
0.2480553286077761 In a blog post this week, researchers Andrea Allievi and Earl Carter of Cisco's Talos Group presented a full code dissection of CryptoWall 2.0 and found a few surprises, aside from using a number of different, sophisticated features to attack systems and evade detection before it can strike.
0.775693177695661 In a first time, the VirusTotal detection rate for this variant of CryptoWall ransomware was zero, afterwards it was improved with further analysis and in time I'm writing it is still low, just 24 on51, which makes this threat very insidious.
0.335239036466991 In January, we examined Cryptowall 2.0 and highlighted new features incorporated into the dropper and Cryptowall binary.
0.623512825011901 In some cases Microsoft claims the malware is branding itself as CryptoWall or CryptoDefense when it informs victims their information has been encrypted.
0.666104572310334 In the analysis published by the Cisco team is reports that the new variant of CryptoWall is able to distinguish between 32- and 64-bit architectures and to execute different versions for each.
0.3277343301952284 Innocent computer users click on an advert served up by ad networks, which takes their browser leapfrogging from website to website, until they eventually arrive at a server containing an exploit kit designed to infect the PC with CryptoWall.
0.4319885508267583 Interestingly, based on post-mortem data collected by researchers, CryptoWall appears to have been less effective at producing income than CryptoLocker.
0.761577958873659 It then creates the main Cryptowall Thread and tries to download the TOR client used for communication from one of the following URLs:

0.306730050253681 Last month researchers with Barracuda Labs found a CryptoWall variant with certificate signed by Comodo being distributed through ads on a handful of different websites.
0.15258357695879 Like CryptoWall, it uses Tor to communicate with a command and control server, and gives the victim a link to a Tor "hidden service" site-either presented within the malware itself, or reachable through a Tor gateway URL.
0.1975904107707243 Malvertising campaign delivers digitally signed CryptoWall ransomware.
0.0970810776436511 Malvertising is an attack that happens when attackers embed malicious code - in this case code that led to the latest iteration of CryptoWall - into otherwise legitimate ads to spread malware via drive-by downloads.

0.4868777520782381 Some payments made to these addresses did not fit the pattern of CryptoWall ransom payments and may be income from other, unrelated criminal activity.
0.708319975066837 SophosLabs threat researcher Anand Ajjan says Cryptowall has the same code as Cryptodefense, and only differs in the name.

0.1568599933521677 Talos recently discussed an Angler Exploit Kit campaign delivering Cryptowall 3.0 and this threat is doing the same.
0.040791355068831 The Angler Exploit Kit (EK) is throwing a new line in the cybercrime waters with the addition of an exploit for Adobe Flash Player, and the CryptoWall 3.0 ransomware as a payload.
0.0702140241424813 The attack serves browsers with some obfuscated Javascript that kicks off a series of redirections that eventually results in the browser hitting a site that serves the CryptoWall malware.
0.612418336409617 The code located in the "explorer.exe" process installs Cryptowall 3.0 in the target system in exactly the same manner as the previous version ("Run" / "RunOnce" registry keys and "Startup" start menu folder).
0.783786278560912 The exploits attack a vulnerability in the end-users' browser and install CryptoWall 2.0 on end-users' computers," the post continued.
0.741274106794147 The family of file-encrypting ransomware known as CryptoWall is proliferating quickly, with more than $1 million paid in ransoms to date.
0.778041081063451 "The latest Cryptowall 2.0, utilizes TOR to obfuscate the command and control channel.
0.3440715996335933 The malware is believed to be CryptoWall because it creates certain files upon execution that are associated with the threat, a blog post said.
0.342269824964002 The new CryptoWall variant is signed by DigiCert, and the details of the signature show that is was signed on Sunday, shortly before Barracuda Labs discovered it.
0.1260114222351669 The new variant of CryptoWall ransomware, like others, is distributed via malicious email and through malvertising campaigns .
0.2979307028173381 The new version, dubbed Cryptowall 3.0 (or Crowti ), uses Tor and I2P ( Invisible Internet Project ) anonymity networks to carry out communication between victims and controllers keeping it away from researchers and law enforcement officials.
0.313266493059264 The only major break from this was a few months ago when we observed a few CryptoWall samples that were using a custom Tor-component to communicate with their command & control servers.
0.683833811413160 The ransomware program provides users with links to several sites that act as Tor gateways that automatically connect user's browser to the CryptoWall decryption service hosted on the Tor network.
0.3261619980234815 The second stage dropper creates a uniquely named version of the main CryptoWall installation code based on an MD5 hash of the computer's name and installs auto-run registry entries for the executable so that it will restart, including one that ensures that it will start even if the computer is rebooted in "safe mode.".
0.244026386228076 The threat actors behind the campaign exploited a Drive-by downloads tactic to deliver the CryptoWall ransomware , the experts discovered that the attack was delivered via the Zedo ad network and originated from the following five Alexa top-ranked domains:
0.175512868598090 The town manager of a hamlet in south eastern New Hampshire has defied demands that he pay a ransom to recover police department computer files taken hostage by Cryptowall, a newer piece of malware that encrypts hard drive contents of infected machines until victims pay for them to be decrypted.
0.148221592615093 The VM checker code, in the first stage of CryptoWall's dropper sequence, checks the system for running processes, searching for VMware and VirtualBox services or the Sandboxie application partitioning library.
0.2184785197650732 There is the chance that data will be lost on the PC and on shared network resources, thanks to ransomware like CryptoWall and CryptoLocker .
0.570351114778634 This appears to also have been the case with the recent Cryptowall example.
0.559369576777787 This campaign is a bit different than others, as it involves two (2) stages of user intervention; the user must execute the initial file attached to the e-mail within a ZIP archive, but then must execute the additional file-a binary file masked as a SCR to appear to be a legitimate Adobe Reader PDF document-which contains the CryptoWall 3.0 payload.
0.695307279004273 This is the Cryptowall ransomware that the Magnitude admin distributes.
0.4792611965869333 This new variant of Cryptowall also implements an anti-VM and anti-emulation checks pass that prevents the execution in a virtualized environment for malware analysis.
0.0425743162063141 This specific variation of Cryptowall did have some interesting characteristics.
0.462964035952409 Threats like CryptoLocker and CryptoWall hold your data hostage, encrypting them and demanding a ransom be paid for their safe return.
0.417090065798624 Through June 13, this sinkhole received connections from 968 unique hosts that appeared to be infected with early CryptoWall variants (see Figure 4).
0.0440853984406942 Top websites deliver CryptoWall ransomware via malvertising.
0.657564067545867 Typically, CryptoWall encrypts the victims' files with a strong RSA 2048 encryption algorithm until the victim pays a ransom fee to get them decrypted.
0.1781436665892429 Unfortunately for users, Cryptowall 3.0 is as destructive as previous variants: it encrypts files found on the infected machines, and asks the victims to pay up in order to get the decryption key.
0.70929574734885 Unlike the crooks SophosLabs found who are trying to copy CryptoLocker but without actually encrypting your files, Cryptowall's encryption can't be reversed without the key.
0.225272868901 Various sources have reported version 3 of CryptoWall has appeared [1] [2] [3].
0.379724803336528 We found that the malware also drops and also spreads CryptoWall and online banking malware.
0.512377824836305 What makes CryptoWall so dangerous is that its malware is able to encrypt files stored not only on local hard drives, but on mapped network shared drives, including cloud storage services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.
0.0925744760652756 When CryptoWall is first executed, it unpacks itself in memory and injects malicious code into new processes that it creates.
0.413378670145181 When executed this file is dropping Cryptowall on the system and compromising it.
0.686640966009918 When opened, the extracted HTML contained a link downloading another zip file, which led to CryptoWall 3.0.
0.339205498081212 When victims opened the file, they were presented with a help window, meanwhile a strain of malware in background downloaded the popular CryptoWall ransomware and executed it.
0.316223982376154 With the above scheme, the attackers serve an instance of CryptoWall ransomware on the victim's system, below the details of the digital signature used for the malicious code.
0.786016472073545 MiniDuke attacks are back in force, says Kaspersky Lab.
0.288831838468669 Miniduke Attacks are Back in Force, Says Kaspersky Lab.
0.587114661680190 The CosmicDuke malware involved in the campaign hit the headlines in July when it surfaced as a 'mongrel' hybrid of the MiniDuke malware family.
0.2132150400864921 The Miniduke advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign that has been dormant for more than a year is.
0.2300103433737237 A complex variant of the MiniDuke malware - first seen almost 18 months ago and which targets NATO and other European government IT systems - has been spotted.
0.535754837060669 A year ago Kaspersky Lab uncovered a MiniDuke campaign that appears to be a clear cyber espionage attack against "governments of Ireland, Romania, Portugal, Belgium and the Czech Republic.".
0.1582970673221739 A year back, Security Researchers from the Antivirus firm Kaspersky found a sophisticated piece of malware which they dubbed as 'MiniDuke', designed specifically to collect and steal strategic insights and highly protected political information, which is a subject to states' security.
0.3200304421854538 After investigating further, F-Secure has found that the malware used in this case is related via its infrastructure to the notorious MiniDuke family which has been used in targeted attacks against NATO and European government agencies.
0.4208742343101865 Anyway, the list of Miniduke's targets suggests that people behind it gather a wide scope of political and business data from the attacked parties.
0.52861139688107 As Ars previously reported , MiniDuke combined older and newer styles: it was written in assembly language, which rendered its file size tiny, and it uses hijacked Twitter accounts and automated Google searches to ensure that it can receive continuous instructions.
0.3026112078504369 As of today, the newly discovered MiniDuke sample was still seeking encrypted command and control instructions via an active Twitter account, with a single instruction dated February 21st, 2012.
0.2240450392903916 Attackers behind the MiniDuke spy campaign have targeted government entities and other organizations around the world since at least 2011.
0.0622940874550881 Attackers with a control infrastructure based in China are leveraging the same vulnerability exploited by Miniduke to attack Uyghur and Tibetan activists with new exploits.
0.544298099583106 Based on the analysis, it appears that MiniDuke's creators provide a dynamic backup system that also can fly under the radar.
0.599423392261506 Blocking "MiniDuke" Type Threats Using Exploit Interception.
0.788732546539032 CosmicDuke : In April 2014, experts at F-Secure, while investigating on MiniDuke malicious code discovered a link to a new strain of malware, dubbed CosmicDuke, belonging to Cosmu family.
0.292582967968065 Early 2013 experts at Kaspersky Lab and Hungary's Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) uncovered a cyber espionage campaign dubbed Miniduke which targeted dozens of computers at government agencies across Europe in.
0.05583186274940965 Evidence of an older MiniDuke iteration was included in Bitdefender's blog.
0.4185745317683152 Fascinating MiniDuke backdoor hits again.
0.3968868852163709 First and foremost is Miniduke's infection vector.
0.0607484582928440 From one of the old style Miniduke servers we were able to extract a list of victims and their corresponding countries.
0.433671055660107 However, on further analysis in April this year, Hirvonen and his team discovered that the Cosmu malware family used the same loader as MiniDuke.
0.1513731075772144 In fact, it went all the way back to the notorious Russian APT family MiniDuke, known to have been used in targeted attacks against NATO and European government agencies.
0.540803642452110 In reality MiniDuke activities were reported for first time a couple of weeks ago by FireEye security firm that noted a malicious agent able to infecting machines by circulating compromised PDFs.
0.635721413336826 In the wake of our publications from 2013, the Miniduke campaigns have stopped or at least decreased in intensity.
0.069500418726611 In this case, "666" is specified as the preferred image base address whereas in MiniDuke's case, it is referenced as stray bytes in its code.
0.04280134053541828 Indeed, recent security headlines feature old school malware attacks, like the MiniDuke.
0.1143550998776319 Initially CosmicDuke was initially linked to MiniDuke because the researchers discovered that the two malicious code was using the same loader, the new discovery confirms the suspect.
0.392833887409131 Kaspersky and CrySys Lab found that the underground network wielding MiniDuke
0.1595642745576574 Kaspersky Lab researchers have discovered that the old style Miniduke implants from 2013 are still around.
0.577672036733834 Kaspersky Lab's team of experts published a new research report that analyzed a series of security incidents involving the use of the recently discovered PDF exploit in Adobe Reader (CVE-2013-6040) and a new, highly customized malicious program known as MiniDuke.
0.05974186259794611 Kaspersky Lab's team of experts recently published a new research report that analyzed that Cyber criminals have targeted government officials in more than 20 countries, including Ireland and Romania with a new piece of malware called ' MiniDuke '.
0.741259501186162 Last week, Kaspersky Lab and the cryptography research lab at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (called CrySys Lab) revealed the first details about MiniDuke, customized malware that takes advantage of a now-patched Adobe Reader vulnerability (CVE-2013-6040), affecting versions 9 through 11 of the software.

0.0638879925887112 MiniDuke, as researchers from Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab
0.398862816036927 MiniDuke, as researchers from Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab have dubbed the threat, bears the hallmark of viruses first encountered in the mid 1990s, when shadowy groups such as 29A engineered innovative pieces of malware for fun and then documented them in an E-Zine by the same name.
0.2358537254907607 MiniDuke espionage ring began earlier than first reports suggest.
0.4349043778463531 MiniDuke hackers target European governments and researchers.
0.2480131683909152 MiniDuke has taken hold of government agencies, think tanks, a US-based
0.15665516761149 Miniduke is rather unique among other APT campaigns; at the time of its initial discovery it used a custom backdoor, written in the "relatively outdated" Assembler programming language; had a peculiar C&C infrastructure with multiple redundancy paths including Twitter accounts, and a form of steganography in which the developers stealthily transferred their updated executables in .gif files.
0.537800425300176 MiniDuke malware is written in assembly language with its tiny file size (20KB), and uses hijacked Twitter accounts for Command & Control and incase twitter accounts are not active, the malware located backup control channels via Google searches.
0.2803325222368465 MiniDuke - the cyberspy malware aimed at governments and agencies in Europe
0.4185677927178389 MiniDuke - the extremely small and highly customized Asembler-based backdoor used in the past to target mostly government entities and institutions around the world - has been spotted again, this time...
0.385776851408667 MiniDuke's highly customized backdoor was written in Assembler and is very small in size, being only 20kb," added Kaspersky.
0.566239759036178 New Miniduke adds a handful of "fox tail" feature to throw off researchers.
0.331931034052591 Now, once again the MiniDuke virus is spreading in wild via an innocent looking but fake PDF documents.
0.538116216745086 On Saturday, Romanian anti-virus firm Bitdefender revealed in a blog post that an older sample of MiniDuke has turned up, leading the firm to posit that the malware has been in use since as early as June 2011.
0.2111823648546390 Our research indicates that attackers engaged in APT campaigns may have adapted the exploit made infamous by the MiniDuke campaign and have incorporated it into their arsenal.
0.074455788431976 Over a year ago, security firm Kaspersky published its findings on a new strain of malware it dubbed "MiniDuke."
0.1867255521076829 Probably yes, but only because these tools require some intellectual effort to be used, as opposed to purely running off of malice, greed, and pathologic cunning (and the knowledge of where to download your next Miniduke-like Trojan).
0.344943994395760 Putting two and two together, it wasn't hard to speculate that MiniDuke was being used for state-sponsored espionage.
0.789320215120393 Quisquater, a professor at the Université catholique de Louvain, told Meyer that his computer was infected approximately six months ago, by a variant of the MiniDuke malware.
0.1004513317669943 Researchers noted some similarities between previous attacks and MiniDuke, an indication the attackers could be borrowing and adapting their respective tactics.
0.461646335750474 Security experts collected further evidences of the link between the CosmicDuke, Miniduke and OnioDuke Advanced Persistent Threat campaigns.
0.4030295301664804 The beginning of 2014 saw the re-activation of MiniDuke, an APT campaign from early 2013.
0.599578837725063 The Carbon backdoors, meanwhile, share characteristics with other attack platforms such as Tilded and Flame, as well as some subtle connections to Miniduke .
0.503011349711804 "The discovery of this older MiniDuke malware strain raises questions about the origin of the 2012 samples and the malware as a whole," said Bitdefender Chief Security Strategist Catalin Cosoi.
0.567821054990543 The main "new" Miniduke backdoor (aka TinyBaron or CosmicDuke) is compiled using a customizable framework called "BotGenStudio", which has flexibility to enable/disable components when the bot is constructed.
0.322764605540006 The malicious Tor exit node located in Russia that added malicious code to the software downloaded by users has been tied to the APT actors wielding the MiniDuke backdoor.
0.053436961298758 The malware family discovered was using the same loader as MiniDuke stage 3 .
0.1066858908192203 The malware in question, known as MiniDuke, had many interesting features: it was tiny in size at 20KB.
0.2099097284910581 "The malware used in this case is, however, not a version of MiniDuke.
0.606663326032870 The Miniduke advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign is back.
0.4864398721449073 The Miniduke APT campaign is back in business with new tools to steal data from new targets in an assortment of countries from all over the globe.
0.250138581939096 The old style Miniduke implants from 2013 are still around and being used during the current campaigns.
0.57515157798017 The victims are various, some research institutes and other entities including an US think tank were attacked by a malware dubbed "MiniDuke".
0.654047707768346 These three items helped us identify the similarities between MiniDuke and Zegost.
0.1936681062257186 This dropped a variant of the MiniDuke malware which covertly opens a backdoor onto the infected computer.
0.796642825310523 This dropper opens its decoy PDF directly using the ShellExecute API whereas MiniDuke's dropper creates a BAT file that kills the existing acrobat process along with opening the decoy PDF.
0.1011861363625651 This has no connection with the MiniDuke malware payload.)
0.300810317581228 To investigate similar cases, we have created a tool for extracting the payloads and the decoy documents from MiniDuke PDF files.
0.309709111428834 What is very interesting is that if MiniDuke is not able to receive Tweets it execute Google searches to receive orders from C&C servers.
0.391111088104849 While investigating on MiniDuke malware, experts at F-Secure discovered a surprising link to a new malware, dubbed CosmicDuke, belonging to Cosmu family.
0.309917348048040 While the old style Miniduke implants were used to target mostly government victims, the new style CosmicDuke implants have a somehow different typology of victims.
0.689261535013511 With Dennis Fisher out of pocket at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Ryan Naraine hijacks the Digital Underground podcast and gets on the phone with Kaspersky Lab research guru Costin Raiu to talk about the intricacies of the miniDuke malware campaign.
0.374925132207027 Yet another large-scale threat was detected in Q2: MiniDuke , an APT campaign from early 2013 reignited, bringing in some serious and novel additions.
0.171642412791891 Tinba uses a DGA based on a hard-coded domain and seed which are unique to each sample generating 1,000 unique domains.
0.697762991337506 "64-bit is a class of computer architecture which basically allows the usage of additional computer resources [such as] memory, [and so on]," Raff said. "However, it also requires the operating system and applications to support this architecture. Tinba now added support to inject itself to such applications."
0.0709324156691856 A few months ago, Tinba's source code was leaked in the wild.
0.343646084340243 An example of an injected form from Tinba Trojan targeting U.S. Bank customers.
0.3760286478768609 " As observed in several other Trojan-bankers and advanced malwares, Tinba utilizes a RC4 encryption algorithm when communication with its Command & Control (C&C) servers.
0.0954911570070657 "Banks that deploy these types of systems are able to effectively detect and block the activity of Tinba, Tilon, Shylock and many other financial malware strains that use this same Man in the Browser (MitB) tactic.".
0.4933022411650581 Both a default list of target URLs and an injection script are encrypted within Tinba's code.
0.0922883860094425 But in order to gather this information efficiently, Tinba must do three things:
0.456939033840526 But Trusteer has discovered that Tinba and Tilon have been recently modified to try out a simpler approach: phishing and blocking users from the actual banking page.
0.0491170342318731 Department of Statistics home page was compromised with malicious Flash code in order to exploit Internet Explorer users and install a banking trojan, called Tinba
0.548726925934357 DGA , DGA.Changer , domain generation algorithm , Malware , Matsnu , PushDo , Research Lab , tinba
0.655349253955557 For 'Tinba', like many botnets, that information could be browsing data, login credentials, or even banking information, all decided by the botnet master and changed to whatever they desire at any time.
0.4098018185214070 Further, the old-school Tinba targeted only a handful of financial institutions; the new-model malware has broadened its scope to include a larger number of banks globally - including in the United States and Canada.
0.695517984320572 If the first domain does not respond properly, Tinba simply moves on to the next domain down the chain.
0.761416905897079 If the system is vulnerable, then the exploit executes a malicious code which downloads and executes the malware payload, Tinba Trojan.
0.64102431487051 In the attack on the Carnegie Mellon domain, the school's Department of Statistics home page was compromised with malicious Flash code in order to exploit Internet Explorer users and install a banking trojan, called Tinba , on their machines, Segura said.
0.515371432033793 In the original version of Tinba, the malware did not support code injection into 64 bit processes.
0.671372012087721 Researchers at IBM Security Trusteer say that new and nasty variants of the Tinba Trojan, said to be the world's smallest malware, are emerging, and they're targeting European banks.
0.0586738736621700 Researchers say that the files turned out to be the source code for version one of Tinba, which was identified in 2012, and is the original, privately sold version of the crimeware kit.
0.577827352825278 SC Magazine > News > Banking malware Tinba infects 60,000 users in Turkey.
0.328993150906086 The cybercriminal group behind the attacks is known as EITest and has distributed an online banking Trojan called Tinba in the past, according to researchers from Malwarebytes.
0.423727578170672 The next keynote was by Peter Kruse of the CSIS Security Group, with the research of Tinba banking malware: a highly sophicticated trojan targeting users mostly in the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
0.0800002302782871 There are three places in which cryptography occurs in Tinba: In both the message header and data for messages sent the bot and the server, and in the default target list used by the bot when it fails to download newer files from the server.
0.731975212382193 This presents the possibility that more than one group could be using the new version of the Tinba trojan.
0.1857090404390583 This version of the "tiny banker" a.k.a. Tinba trojan boasts some pretty potent features, including new detection evasion tactics.
0.403710757284356 threat was named Tinba, or Tinybanker, because of its small size among banking malware, approximately 20 kilobytes, according to researchers at Trend Micro and CSIS Security Group, who wrote the report.
0.496838415459689 Tinba also injects itself into both "explorer.exe" and "svchost.exe" processes.
0.0798201427431229 Tinba got its name from its extraordinarily small size - its code is approximately 20 kilobytes in size, a remarkably small number for banking malware.
0.27901620807451 Tinba has affected more than 60,000 users in Turkey, primarily stealing login details from sites like Facebook, free German webmail service GMX, Google and Microsoft.
0.1006801863926485 Tinba is the latest in a long and distinguished line of banker Trojans that are designed specifically to relieve victims of their money through background monitoring of online banking sessions or modification of Web pages.
0.256139794462690 Tinba now added support to inject itself to such applications.".
0.561768705323133 Tinba particularly targeted banks in Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
0.1511187071153208 Tinba receives its instructions and updates from four C&C servers, whose domains are hardcoded into the malware.
0.653924494721623 Tinba, the pied piper leading your banking credentials into the hands of hackers.
0.697135074162686 Tinba, The Turkish Incident" (a 24-page PDF that gives great insights into the malware family).
0.3457172239539091 Tinba uses a DGA based on a hard-coded domain and seed which are unique to each sample generating 1,000 unique domains.
0.1665296882522695 Tinba's Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) seems to be different from DGAs we have seen in other malware families to date.
0.656832364452660 Unlike the Turkish Incident, where Tinba was being dropped by the Blackhole Exploit Kit, in the current spam, Tinba is directly attached to the email message.
0.1102907001215430 We estimate that there are more than 60,000 users affected by Tinba in Turkey..

0.1147537154523313 Although Moose has been specifically targeting consumer Linux routers so far, it's still a concern for enterprises, Bilodeau says.
0.270590086741307 Because of the way that the worm communicates, the ESET researchers were unable to determine the number of devices that have been infected by Moose, which they say they first found late in July of 2014.

0.1197065961824551 Perhaps most interesting of all, however, is to try to understand the purpose of the Moose worm.
0.767980375195028 The main purpose of Moose, however, appears to be to create a network of covert HTTP proxies that can be used by the worm's command and control (C&C) servers to communicate with social networks.
0.724032153601423 The malware, which researchers have dubbed Linux/Moose, could be used for a wide variety of purposes -- including DNS hijacking, DDoSing, and deep network penetration -- but so far attackers only seem to be using it for tame social networking fraud.

0.4054918761462815 Based on information ICS-CERT has obtained from Symantec and F-Secure, the software installers for these vendors were infected with malware known as the Havex Trojan.
0.735371578123944 Compared to newer HAVEX versions (>= version 038), this version required another loader as seen below.
0.279327559837541 During the spring of 2014, we noticed that Havex took a specific interest in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and the group behind it uses an innovative trojan horse approach to compromise victims.
0.4829029189358793 Experts at F-Secure recently noticed that Havex was used by attackers to hit Industrial Control Systems (ICS), the criminals have customized the malicious agent infecting software available for download from ICS/SCADA manufacturer websites in an attempt to infect the computers where the software is installed to.
0.502229017906190 Experts question whether the Havex malware campaign targeting three European industrial control system software vendors is merely a dry run for something bigger.
0.748686061512826 FireEye recently analyzed the capabilities of a variant of Havex (referred to by FireEye as "Fertger" or "PEACEPIPE"), the first publicized malware reported to actively scan OPC servers used for controlling SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) devices in critical infrastructure (e.g., water and electric utilities), energy, and manufacturing sectors.
0.79420831394017 From Sep. 2011 to May 2014, through 68 different versions, I do see some improvements, like moving lots of hardcoded values into a single encrypted configuration file, public-key cryptography, information harvester, etc. After we understand the Havex module downloader, we could get all its modules from the server side.
0.1283668911270371 F-Secure and Symantec recently had spotted the attackers targeting mainly energy and some manufacturing firms with the so-called Havex Trojan, and Symantec as far back as March saw the group shifting its focus onto energy firms, with half of the targets in energy and 30% in energy control systems.

0.1478309692634318 However, over the past few months F-Secure analyzed 88 Havex variants, 146 C&C servers and 1500 related IP addresses in an investigation which revealed a narrowing of focus by the group to Industrial Control Systems (ICS).
0.584134654732056 ICS operators have to take note that the structure of the HAVEX binaries resemble much of what we see in common Windows malware - more so now that we've seen Windows 7 64-bit infections.
0.616951318852698 ICS-CERT has posted a TLP Amber report to its secure portal related to our analysis of ICS/SCADA-focused Havex components .
0.520807312087269 In addition to the usual phishing messages and exploit kits, the attackers compromised the websites of three industrial application vendors and swapped their legitimate installers with ones that would also install HAVEX when downloaded and run.
0.620517117739501 In June 2014 experts at F-Secure discovered instances of the Havex malware used to target Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in surgical attacks implementing " watering-hole attack" scheme which involved ICS vendor site as intermediary target.
0.04829412129991994 In June, based on the details we extracted from the Havex DLLs we blocked 124 command and control servers.
0.3498053932912076 In the case of HAVEX, the energy industry, and specifically power plants based in Europe, seems to be the primary target.
0.792259238978206 It is important to note that ICS-CERT testing has determined that the Havex payload has caused multiple common OPC platforms to intermittently crash.
0.05578937395934635 It is possible that the HAVEX RAT is itself a newer version of the SYSMain RAT, although both tools are still in use concurrently and have been operated by the attackers since at least 2011.
0.404100142514361 Meanwhile, F-Secure has claimed that the attackers (who are sometimes also known as "Energetic Bear") used a remote access trojan (RAT) named Havex to hunt for vulnerable industrial control systems (ICS) with a view to ultimately accessing critical infrastructure used to manage electrical, water, oil, gas and data supplies.
0.1562496877437704 One of the primary tools leveraged in Operation Dragonfly is Havex.
0.1763253579077995 Our analysis of Havex sample codes also uncovered its "ICS/SCADA sniffing" behavior.
0.2084587637087553 Over the last week, F-Secure Labs has taken a look at attacks from the "Energetic Bear" hacking group , Havex, which targets the energy sector , and now CosmicDuke, which is aimed at targets in Ukraine, Poland, Turkey, and Russia.
0.574997467290397 Specifically, this Havex variant targets servers involved in OPC (Object linking and embedding for Process Control) communication, a client/server technology widely used in process control systems (for example, to control water pumps, turbines, tanks, etc.).
0.0777421216479906 Symantec researchers have confirmed the findings of their colleagues at F-Secure, who have been monitoring the spreading of the Havex malware family, and have put them in a larger context, tying them ...
0.673305542490694 Symantec's report on the "Dragonfly" group brings additional insight on attackers spreading Havex malware.
0.1114149853924576 The authors of HAVEX certainly understand that OT environments are connected, since the method of transmission is via a downloadable Trojan installed on the websites of several ICS/SCADA manufacturers.
0.4279013490298495 The bad actors behind the Havex campaign mainly targeted companies in the energy industry with the intent to conduct industrial espionage against several American and European companies.
0.4875871719304334 The Havex RAT gathers information about the infected computers and the networks they are connected to and sends it to servers under the control of the attackers.
0.3801301520986679 The Havex RAT is distributed at least through the following channels:
0.2869881357793957 The method by which the Havex RAT targeted industrial control systems owners was clever.
0.2021138377837683 The remote access tool (RAT) HAVEX became the focus of the security industry after it was discovered to have played a major role in a campaign targeting industrial control systems (ICS ).

0.416630029251313 Researchers from Trend Micro discovered that a targeted attack against a government agency in Taiwan was conducted using a variant of the PlugX remote access tool (RAT) which abuses the popular file hosting service Dropbox.
0.36784133022246 Since then, PLUGX variants have been using other applications to hide their tracks from antimalware software.
0.556612838200090 Szappanos, who has followed Plugx samples for the past two years, posited that the group deploying Plugx must have made the first attempt, which failed to execute properly.
0.3854627473606816 Taiwanese government entity which used a variant of the PlugX RAT
0.584377491419716 The following are just some of the notable techniques they used: \u2022 Cloud-based file storage platform abuse: This June, threat actors used a Type II PlugX remote access tool (RAT) variant to be able to use Dropbox as a download site for a backdoor's command-and- control (C&C) settings.3 Abusing the cloud-based file storage platform allowed threat actors to better evade detection despite the implementation of network traffic monitoring.
0.1368571118890016 The PlugX instances analyzed by by researchers at Trend Micro have, identified as BKDR_PLUGX.ZTBF-A and TROJ_PLUGX.ZTBF-A, implements classic features of any other RAT, it installs a backdoor with that allows an attacker the complete control of compromised machines.
0.2461080898449112 The PlugX RAT is then loaded in the background without the user's knowledge.
0.135510339778860 The samples we obtained are detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_PLUGX.ZTBF-A and TROJ_PLUGX.ZTBF-A.
0.2491281545019212 The two types of malware belong to different categories of PlugX, the second one (TROJ_PLUGX.ZTBF-A,) is considered a new version which implements incorporates anti-forensic techniques, an authentication mechanism of the attacker, a different encryption algorithm, extended configuration, and more protocols and functions.
0.722904288895367 Threat analyst Maersk Menrige explained in a blog post that the attack, which was discovered in May, used the PlugX remote access tool (RAT) to target the Taiwanese government.

0.0618608230786892 Autoit downloaded dozens of other malware components including some of the most power mawlare downloaders like Virut and Trojan.VBInject which further downloaded more malware components.
0.707965213899871 By the end of the year, CERT Polska had used DNS sinkholes to take down the botnets Dorkbot, Virut, and Domain Silver, Inc., and any malware of interest using the Polish .pl domain space.
0.424518103351600 CERT Polska, a computer emergency response team in Poland that is run under the aegis of the country's Research and Academic Network (NASK), has announced takedown action against a raft of web servers associated with the Virut family of malware.
0.0446522682048641 eWeek reported in January 2013 that Virut controlled roughly 300,000 computers.
0.3744793309597137 However beware while taking a backup of your data files, malware like Virut (Virus + Trojan) can also infect executables (locally or on open SMB shares) by injecting its DNA and can infect HTML files by injecting malicious IFrames into them.
0.4104938984889827 In 2007, researchers at malware research group Team Furry published a brain dump of information that they'd collected about the individuals they believed created and ran the Virut botnet.
0.171983362753551 In late 2012 Symantec estimated the size of its botnet at 300,000 machines, while Kaspersky reported that Virut was responsible for 5.5% of infections in Q3 2012, making it the fifth most widespread threat of the time."
0.511683541856311 NASK , the domain registrar that operates the ".pl" Polish top-level domain registry, said that on Thursday it began assuming control over 23 .pl domains that were being used to operate the Virut network.
0.424889260942566 Security experts in Poland on Thursday quietly seized domains used to control the Virut botnet , a huge army of hacked PCs that is custom-built to be rented out to cybercriminals.
0.1329072891249908 Security giant Symantec recently estimated Virut's size at 300,000 machines; Russian security firm Kaspersky said Virut was responsible for 5.5 percent of malware infections in the third quarter of 2012.
0.1134709201587658 The company's associated report gives four examples of botnets shut down: Dragon, Grum, Slenfbot and Virut.
0.671413681276499 The Exerevenue.com PPI program died off in 2010, but cached copies of the site offer a fascinating glimpse into the Virut business model.
0.632631848816212 The Virut botnet spreads through executable file infection (via infected USB sticks and other media), and through websites that use compromised HTML to infect vulnerable browsers.
0.072589974538285 These downloaders have been detected on computers in the GBOT and Virut botnets.
0.736889371372342 This bot has been aggressively establishing itself by seeding with another pay-per-install bot, Virut.
0.2223282927191624 Virut was responsible for 5.5% of infections in Q3 2012, making it the fifth most widespread threat of the time..
0.306006318262833 We draw this conclusion because all of the compromised computers we analyzed also had Trojan downloaders and other infamous Pay-per-Install (PPI) malware such as Win32/Virut .
0.515280645729974 We find infected files in memory, unhook APIs and clear out any malicious code that's been injected. Because of our proactive approach, all 23 million Baidu Antivirus cloud engine users are completely protected from Virut

0.497244740399533 A VirusTotal search indicated that the URL was previously submitted and that the malware was vawtrak.
0.487956602457084 According to Trend Micro researchers, this latest Vawtrak spreading campaign comes in the form of fake FedEx and American Airlines emails that urge recipients to download the attached Microsoft Word file that supposedly contains details about a failed delivery or an airline ticket.
0.3276220043095353 An example of banking malware botnet is Vawtrak, also known as NeverQuest and Snifula.

0.3683319076025235 Also, Sophos noted that in the Windows 8 version of Internet Explorer, plugins are now disabled by default, blocking a major target for exploit kits and BlackHole attacks.
0.2387457107903161 Also, there are indications that this exploit will soon be rolled into the BlackHole exploit kit .
0.395528098011782 Also, we've mentioned in our previous post of a better way to handle the black hole exploit kit than focusing at the infection point.
0.539837240687271 Although inexpensive, the Blackshades RAT has an extensive set of capabilities such as keystroke logger, web cam control, full file access, etc. More than enough for the cyber attacker to assume the full identity of the owner of the compromised computer to allow them easy access to the business critical servers inside the data center as depicted in the diagram.
0.648388746606125 Although several other "technically sophisticated" techniques were used in the attacks iSIGHT investigated, the malware that extracted payment card information from POS systems is dubbed "Trojan.POSRAM" and correlates strongly with another POS malware known as "BlackPOS," according to the report.
0.633552460425783 Although the Java exploit we researched is part of the g01pack exploit kit, it is interesting to note that some implementation details are similar to the exploit used by BlackHole for CVE-2012-1723, identified in mid-2012 (described in a ).
0.0508247768556802 Although these intrusions have been identified and are widely attributed to Russia's government, there are several others whose attribution to the Russian Federation is less clear like MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, BlackEnergy Bot, SandWorm, and Quedagh.
0.0718914209774493 Although this trend is not new, the last version (version nature, for people to act not only through traditional protests where 2.0) of Blackhole -a well known exploit kit- proves that attackers they are physically present, but also express their discontent using a actively incorporate new exploits and functionalities with the purpose variety of electronic media.
0.1605024204595778 Among the exploits being used by Sandworm Team to deliver BlackEnergy and gain footholds in organizations is CVE-2014-4114 , a zero-day vulnerability in Windows OLE that impacts multiple versions of the operating system and could enable remote code execution.
0.718590468226116 Among the most common ways it reaches user systems are: infected removable drives, or the user has visited sites compromised with the Blackhole Exploit Kit.
0.402848551129979 Among those arrested in the CarderProfit sting was Michael Hogue , the alleged co-creator of Blackshades.
0.490840975804570 Amongst the many interesting sections of the report is a discusson of the notorious Blackhole exploit kit, which we have written about frequently on Naked Security..
0.635647285919293 An advertisement for a cracked version of Blackshades on a overworld hacker forum.
0.489497251852382 An Internet search on the unique malware "hash" signature noted in Trend's malware writeup indicates that the new BlackPOS verison was created on June 22, 2014 , and that as late as Aug. 15, 2014 only one of more than two-dozen anti-malware tools (McAfee) detected it as malicious.
0.584533786155656 An out-of-the-blue tweet from a Dutch researcher kicked off an unprecedented 24-hour rumor mill yesterday concerning the arrest of Paunch, a hacker allegedly behind the notorious Blackhole Exploit Kit.
0.33098867619701 and because Blackhole has an updatable framework and already has a foothold on thousands of sites, we anticipate that the number of sites compromised with this new zero-day will escalate rapidly in the coming days," he Malware peddlers have also begun their efforts to drive traffic to those domains, as witnessed by a slew of emails purportedly coming from the Dutch branch of the accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward, trying to trick people into following the offered link with news that the VAT rate will increase starting on October 1, 2012.
0.201505988270920 And here is a prime example of just how targeted this advertising can be: The most common reason miscreants purchase Internet traffic is to redirect it to sites they've retrofitted with exploit kits like Blackhole.
0.3882066900935644 And obviously, the overlap we've seen for a while now too, the exploits work their way from zero-day targeted attacks, and then turn around a few weeks later and that same exploit is now in BlackHole exploit kit.
0.755572434980719 And the exploit is expected to show up if it hasn't already in the widely used BlackHole exploit toolkit, one of the most popular threats on the web.
0.4197173562058278 And this exercise could be an ongoing trend, fraud experts predict, as more breaches linked to malware, such as BlackPOS, take aim at the retail and hospitality industries.
0.432211082835396 Andrew Komarov, CEO at cyber intelligence company IntelCrawler, has been investigating the BlackPOS malware since March 2013.
0.1877539938523955 Andrew Komarov , CEO of the cybercrime intelligence firm IntelCrawler, says the malware strain known as BlackPOS behind the Target attack and likely the Neiman Marcus attack has been linked to at least six other retailers.

0.616868192411063 As predicted, since his arrest in early October, the two kits - of which Blackhole was the most used one - stopped receiving updates and the exploits they wielded got stale, making the kits a way less effective tools than before.
0.787512848061301 As previously reported , the breach appears to have been carried out using an off-the-shelf malware known as BlackPOS - which may have also been involved in the Neiman Marcus attack.
0.352320047638145 As reported in the Cisco 2014 Midyear Security Report , when Paunch-the alleged creator and distributor of the Blackhole exploit kit-was arrested in Russia in late 2013, other malware creators wanted to fill the gap.
0.63056722654073 As said above, the whole range of tools, plugins, and other components of BlackEnergy is still undefined.
0.345308254504125 As the FBI reported in the criminal complaint , the nastyware that turned up in the search of his computers and the analysis of his electronic slime trail included evidence of keylogging, plus messages relating to the use of two remote-access tools (RATs) or Trojans - Blackshades and Darkcomet - which can be used to control victims' computers, including turning on a computer's camera.

0.661325373176427 The arrests follow an FBI-led operation in May that resulted in the arrests of 100 alleged Blackshades RAT users across more than a dozen countries.
0.207447638348399 The author of Blackhole, an exploit kit that booby-traps hacked Web sites to serve malware, has done so well for himself renting his creation to miscreants that the software has emerged as perhaps the most notorious and ubiquitous crimeware product in the Underweb.
0.2283513637613773 The author of Blackhole is known by the handle Paunch.

0.1062150128039696 The bot code, generated by the crimeware kit's "builder" component, typically is distributed via social engineering attacks in email and social networking sites, or is foisted by an exploit pack like Eleonore or Blackhole, which use hacked Web sites and browser flaws to quietly install the malware.
0.591783423301493 The bottom line is even if the malware isn't a BlackPOS variant, it's still powerful.
0.461756641844190 The bottom line is that all three attacks used recycled versions (variants) of PoS malware, whose purpose is to compromise the operating system (in the case of BlackPoS, MS Windows) of credit card sales devices, giving the attacker access to user rights on the device, and consequently to the information stored on it.
0.412687984760919 The bulletin said the " BlackEnergy " penetration recently had been detected by several companies.".

BlackEnergy is bot based malware with a plugin architecture that lets it adapt to a variety of uses like DDoS, credential theft, or spam distribution," he said.
0.247057173528137 The malicious program is downloaded and installed using the BlackHole Exploit Kit.
0.321165438940552 The man believed to be responsible for distributing the notorious Blackhole malware toolkit has been arrested in Russia, a source told Reuters today .
0.0504412159179575 The most popular injection was related to the Blackhole Exploit kit, covering almost 3,000 websites.
0.05833736096901820 The new version offered many options, including statistics about Windows 8 and Mobile Device infection, an option to have "less obvious" URLs for your Blackhole Exploit address, and the ability to automatically regenerate your .exe files in ways that would not be detected by AV engines.
0.362325375258371 The note is not lying - you will be forwarded, but to a Russian domain hosting the Blackhole exploit kit.
0.4628627985533999 The number of crimeware kits sold in online black markets dropped by 87 percent after Russian authorities last fall arrested "Paunch," the alleged creator of the "Blackhole" kit.
0.736660499292333 The number of exploit kits available on the market has dropped by 87 percent this year, mainly due to the arrest of Paunch , the alleged creator of the popular Blackhole exploit kit, according to Cisco
0.1224548614692161 The offer, of course, is false, and clicking on links in the email will only trigger multiple redirections that are typical among Blackhole exploit kit (BHEK) spam runs.
0.724122356657411 The operation of BlackPOS can be summed up as follows:
0.210723142211332 The operation that likely led to the infection of Target's point-of-sale (POS) systems - allowing attackers to claim data on 40 million payment cards, among heaps of other information - is known as KAPTOXA, according to a release by iSIGHT Partners.
0.630031298566885 The operation that likely led to the infection of Target's point-of-sale systems is known as KAPTOXA, according to a release by iSIGHT Partners.
0.2240831292608164 The paper shows how to employ RSA's ECAT and Security Analytics products together to detect a popular variant of BlackPOS.
0.1823771109653169 The perfect example of these developments is the release of Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) 2.0, which was a direct response to successful efforts to block previous BHEK versions.
0.50648119757796 The post The aftermath of the Blackhole exploit kit's demise appeared first on Trend Micro Simply Security .
0.545066305178457 The presence of BlackPOS is one indicator that the culprits behind the suspected Home Depot attack might be the same people who used BlackPOS to lift 40 million payment card accounts from Target in December.
0.1612464189675980 "The price of such an exploit if it were sold privately would be about $100,000," wrote Paunch , the nickname used by the BlackHole author.
0.747218652073364 The reason that nothing happened is that the javascript that is running in the background is trying to load a web page known for hosting the BlackHole exploit kit .
0.735811700982746 The redirection technique adopted by the attackers is similar to that previously used in the Blackhole exploit kit , but there is no evidence of a direct link to the popular crimeware kit, experts in fact revealed that the campaign could be part of a Mesh Network attack described by Sucuri early in 2014.
0.329466545449405 The report also includes an in-depth look at the Blackhole exploit toolkit, which uses many of the techniques highlighted.
0.617958694574693 The report discusses research findings from 2012 such as acceleration of BYOD and cloud, challenges caused by ransomware, continued threats coming from Blackhole, Android is actually at greater risk than PCs, what to expect in 2013, and much more.
0.483347823193842 The researchers have analyzed 245 spam runs leading to the Blackhole kit started in April, May and June They have come to believe that all of these attacks were conducted by a single group or several groups acting in concert with one another, since the botnets sending out spam had a high degree of overlap from one day to the next, compromised sites were used and reused from one attack to another, and the exploit methods used in attacks were similar.
0.51534260359230 The researchers involved in the investigation who analyzed the hacking tools used by the threat actors noticed the use of the BLACKCOFFEE backdoor, which could be used by attackers to perform several operations on the victim's machine such as upload/download files, create a reverse shell, manipulate files, and kill processes.
0.609200337352479 The researchers tried to profile the campaign discovering that the Black Hole Exploit Kit serving URL was used for other previous client-side exploit serving campaigns, in 2012 the same IP was also seen in fact during a malvertising campaign .
0.426403504995268 The rise and fall of Paunch and the market leading Blackhole Web malware exploitation kit - The Blackhole Web malware exploitation kit , represented the primary growth factor for a huge percentage of the successful client-side exploits serving campaigns throughout 2013, until Paunch - the kit's author - and his gang got arrested, leading to an evident decline in malicious Web activity, which was once attributed to the sophistication and systematic updates pushed to the kit's customers.
0.702109111660568 The samples I have are being spread not via Facebook but via Blackhole exploit kit, which is a very effective method.
0.1346395505998856 The scale of the arrests-rarely have so many cybercriminals been arrested in one go-is entirely due to Blackshades' ease of use.
0.4612191463406104 The script opens an IFRAME to a malicious site, which in turn launches a BlackHole exploit "pack" that probes for known browser and plugin weaknesses and then stealthily installs malware on the visitor's PC.
0.775134381231086 The second piece of malware installed by the BlackHole Exploit Pack is designed to steal sensitive user data, such as FTP passwords.
0.3962301547748271 The security community has been focused on the new Java zero-day exploits that appear to have been taken from a Chinese exploit pack (known as Gondad or KaiXin ) used in targeted attacks by the "Nitro" cyber-espionage campaign and then incorporated into criminal operations using the BlackHole Exploit Kit.
0.4894333403488110 The term 'LITE' used to identify the new BlackEnergy variant, indicates that the malware is cheaper and with limited functionalities respect original strain.
0.4815589432266823 The third was in IPS mode on the desktop, which we called "BlackICE Defender".
0.3564845586450686 The tool will scan for service, file, registry and autorun artifacts to determine if any KAPTOXA footprints are present on the POS system.
0.411493992499275 The Trojan has been named the Blackhole RAT (for Remote Access Trojan), and according to Sophos researchers, the backdoor is not yet completely written.
0.500077701905721 The US ICS-CERT has issued a warning about an ongoing sophisticated malware campaign that has hit a number of industrial control systems (ICSs) environments using a variant of the BlackEnergy malware.
0.721556252144132 The user may then be redirected to a third site, but the end goal is to push the victim to a site that serves the Blackhole exploit kit .
0.330933132728606 The various spam campaigns leading to Blackhole.
0.763393595611495 The WinWord.exe payload served to extract and execute the BlackEnergy Lite dropper.
0.603051448785691 There are several other differences that separate BlackEnergy Lite from the 'big' BlackEnergy, in the plugin framework, plugin storage, configuration format, and so forth.
0.2422838304517719 There is a newly identified ongoing attack campaign in which attackers are using compromised Apache HTTP binaries to redirect users to malicious sites serving various flavors of malware, including the Blackhole exploit kit .
0.06234474890629937 There was PoS malware belonging to the Virtual Skimmer and BlackPOS families, which may have been used to carry out the attacks that Mr. Franco described in some of his posts.
0.706345180180634 There's certainly a lot of talk about malware in the web server space (the report about " Apache backdoor being used to serve Blackhole exploit kit " published here on We Live Security has attracted more readers in seven days than any previous article).
0.205348985087597 These captured IPs inserted into the database and published to Blackhole customers.
0.165060497110698 These URLs, if confirmed as BlackHole, show a clear deviation from the conventional URI patterns employed by the toolkit.
0.696237968765719 They also believe that BlackPOS malware has been previously used in attacks against customers of several big US banks.
0.4467697127266384 They are also using RATs, like the aforementioned Blackshades, in targeted attack-like campaigns.
0.4351415471453513 They are also usually sold for far more than the malware itself, in fact Blackshades had a built-in crypter marketplace that it included in it's control panel, to make it easy for the bad guys to find a crypter and apply it to their malware.
0.4618147346776987 They are biased towards known threats, making new ones harder to detect," Dulce added."Hackers may actually take advantage of this, and plant known malware as a method to cover their tracks. Once the forensic team finds BlackPOS, the case is closed and the hackers can move on to the next victim, knowing that their tool was not compromised."
0.3907546721178325 This behavior indicates that the attacker used the Blackhole Exploit Kit in these attacks.
0.3511451292140582 This blog attempts to explain why this toolkit is so hard to detect, the obfuscation techniques it uses to the kind of malware it drops.Though not as widespread as the Blackhole Toolkit, this toolkit looks like it is here to make a mark.
0.129790486219033 This Darkleech exploit (aka Linux.Cdorked) injects malicious redirections into a website that leads to a Blackhole exploit kit (BEK) landing page.
0.116750121517627 "This includes all the files for GE Cimplicity and Siemens WinCC versions which were recently targeted by BlackEnergy.
0.1080943244303348 This is based on the fact that Blackhole Exploit Kit is already collecting stats for Win8 and mobile OSs.
0.4084852657033296 UPDATE: Home Depot Confirms Breach; BlackPOS Implicated.
0.4820614760999939 This is, however, actually a decline in the amount of Java-related exploits compared to the previous half of 2013, which may be attributed to the October arrest of Paunch, the alleged creator of the BlackHole and Cool exploit kits, which were responsible for enabling a sizeable portion of the attacks against Java.
0.05308468613978334 This is the primary difference between it and the Blackhole kit, which is something of an open book.
0.745961809723074 This last one has been mentioned in the context of the Blackhole exploit kit in several places already, but since this vulnerability was released as a 0-day just last month, it's worth noting that it, too, is already part of the new Blackhole exploit lineup, if only to make a point.
0.1916640554808807 This means that if an old version of Blackshades was encrypted with a modern crypter tool, it could potentially bypass an antivirus scan and even email filters that check for malware (Thanks Gmail!).
0.1966576961731130 This month's Security Threat Landscape with Network World's Keith Shaw and Fortinet's Derek Manky covers everything from the FBI crack down on Blackshades to eBay.
0.137130846940149 This new toolkit accounted for 16 per cent of the top web threats in Q4 2012, topped only by Blackhole at 40 per cent.
0.627075452173714 This particular BlackPOS variant is different in several ways from more common variants, suggesting that the code has been changed significantly since the source code for BlackPOS was leaked in 2012.
0.0474965500623333 This routine is different from previous PoS malware such as TSPY_POCARDL.U and TSPY_POCARDL.AB (BlackPOS) that employed the targeted company's own installed service.
0.267199884247131 This tactic is reminiscent of Blackhole Exploit Kit 1.x versions, in which users are directed to compromised websites before the malicious landing page, in an attempt to avoid or at least, make detection difficult.

0.1238387778150338 My website was infected with the Exploit Blackhole Kit virus.
0.1769493820457875 According to news articles [1] the company's 1,797 stores were compromised by an until then unknown malware family later dubbed BlackPOS, which stole around 40 Million credit and debit card records.
0.624952506463781 Although several other "technically sophisticated" techniques were used in the attacks iSIGHT investigated, the malware that extracted payment card information from POS systems is dubbed "Trojan.POSRAM" and correlates strongly with another POS malware known as "BlackPOS," according to the report.
0.3248577760052474 An Internet search on the unique malware "hash" signature noted in Trend's malware writeup indicates that the new BlackPOS verison was created on June 22, 2014 , and that as late as Aug. 15, 2014 only one of more than two-dozen anti-malware tools (McAfee) detected it as malicious.
0.395630467884923 Back in 2012, the experts in Seculert's Research Lab discovered Shamoon : a new type of malware that attacked Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian national oil and natural gas company, and ended up destroying data on about 30,000 computers and servers.
0.632886497827807 A couple of months after the operation, we've seen an increase in Ramnit botnet activity, but it's marginal when compared to the days prior to the takedown.
0.0403917056065387 "As a result of this action, the UK is safer from Ramnit, but it is important that individuals take action now to disinfect their machines, and protect their personal information.".
0.085149631597734 As of now, researchers at Trusteer say they have no way of determining whether Ramnit has actually changed, or if it is just being used as a platform to commit financial fraud .
0.491480681628010 Cybercriminals deployed Ramnit to gain remote access and control of computers infected by the malware, allowing them to disable antivirus protection and steal personal and banking information from people.
0.2202420847481717 Featuring six standard modules such as "Spy module," "Cookie grabber," and "Anonymous FTP server," Ramnit is able to steal website cookies and bank details, as well as monitor Web browsing sessions.
0.747956517356020 Having been alerted to Ramnit by Microsoft, Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (ECC) teamed up with investigators and technology companies across the continent to tackle the botnet, including authorities in Britain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.
0.406801683169622 In 2011, researchers discovered a Ramnit variant that incorporated source code from the banking trojan Zeus, and in 2013, analysts detected an even trickier iteration of the threat that used HTML injection to display subtle changes in banking sites, in order to lure users into revealing their one-time passwords (OTP) to fraudsters.
0.2314930737832959 Investigators estimate that approximately 350,000 Windows computers (clients and servers) are infected with Ramnit at present, and that it has infected about 3.2 million computers in total over the course of its lifetime.
0.436542618340324 It took months to collect, aggregate, and analyze the Ramnit botnet data, which led to sinkholing the C2 infrastructure and delivering critical information to allow law enforcement to take over the C2s and arrest the criminals.
0.0603647012530079 Of the XP threats that were encountered, the top three were: Sality "a file infector, basically a virus\u2026this is the one virus people should be aware of"; Ramnit ("family of malware"); and Vobfus ("Family of worms, spread most commonly through USBs").
0.497179245187394 On further inspection, the team discovered that the file in question was a version of the Ramnit worm dating back to mid-2013 - one of the main features of which is to add VBS code to any HTML files it finds.
0.4566042949154277 "Our researchers came to the conclusion that this particular copy of Zeus Panther was saved onto a fraudster's personal computer that had been infected by a Ramnit variant, and by uploading the Zeus Panther Admin panel from his infected machine, he unknowingly spread the Ramnit worm on his panel's installation page.".
0.442762998408670 Ramnit contains six main modules: a drive scanner for finding sensitive files and banking credentials; an anonymous FTP server for maintaing remote access to an infected machine and exfiltrating data from it; a virtual network computing module, also to obtain access; an FTP grabber to gather logins for a larger number of FTP servers; a cookie grabber, to enable attackers to impersonate victims and hijack Web sessions; and a spy module, which not only monitors user's activity, but can also manipulate banks' websites to prompt users to share even more information, like credit card numbers.
0.3062198005928130 "Ramnit's authors followed the standard approach of malicious financial activities, supporting all basic features required for well-bred financial malware.
0.457053657115179 Rounding out the top five were the Majava exploit (11 percent), Sality virus (10 percent), and the Ramnit virus (nine percent).
0.3031383605221996 Symantec noted that the group behind Ramnit has been operating for at least five years and "has evolved into a major criminal enterprise".
0.369523453854040 The command and control servers for the malware have been shut down and infected users will now be cut off from Ramnit's creators, who used at least 300 web domains to control victims' machines from afar.
0.1659376230739437 The evolved version of Ramnit is a potent threat to enterprises, he said, because it can capture any data in a web session-and as more companies move to web-based software as a service for enterprise applications, that could include almost anything.
0.301991966526676 The hybrid version was able to use the large infected base of machines Ramnit had and emply the capability that Zeus has to harvest financial credentials and compromise a host of banks and coporate networks.
0.2124844662738509 The latest variant of Ramnit, the Windows malware responsible for the recent theft of at least 45,000 Facebook logins , is the latest example of how malware writers and cyber-criminals take "off-the-shelf" hacks and bolt them together to create new ways to teach old viruses new tricks.
0.042554588867203 The RSA team initially suspected that the Ramnit infection was a deliberate move intended to protect the Admin panel from any other fraudsters who might be trying to sneak in and update or reconfigure the botnet control panel.
0.517666942398676 The security company Seculert has been tracking the progress of Ramnit, a worm first discovered in April 2010, and described by Microsoft as "multi-component malware that infects Windows executable files, Microsoft Office files and HTML files" in order to steal "sensitive information such as saved FTP credentials and browser cookies."
0.79474243550528 While the victim is reading the messages, Ramnit connects to its command and control server and obtains the details of a designated money laundering bank account and sets up a wire transfer.
0.367678658173673 Worm steals 45,000 Facebook login credentials, infects victims' friends : The Ramnit worm has been used to steal at least 45,000 Facebook logins with the goals of transmitting malicious links to victims' friends and gaining remote access to corporate networks.
0.700860137099548 In 2013 we also fixed the first case of targeting supply chains - not being able to reach big organizations, cybercriminals get their 'weak point', compromising contractors, as in the Icefog attacks, said Vitaly Kamluk, Principal Security Researcher of Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis Team.
0.383553964930170 A BBS posting of the Mac Icefog trojan, bundled with the graphics program Img2icns The backdoor portions of the program are similar to their Windows counterparts: they collect information about the host system, report it back to the command and control server and then request commands to execute.
0.192730770699008 Discovered last fall, the Icefog attackers targeted a variety of organizations and government agencies in Japan and South Korea and researchers believe the group comprised a small number of highly skilled operators who went after select targets very quickly.
0.630868695880952 Icefog Team went dark after just after the revelation on Kaspersky investigation in September, the experts at Kaspersky Lab continued their analysis digging into domains used in the attack that had been sinkholed by the security company to discover the extension of the infection and localize the victims of the attack through the connection that malicious agents do versus the Command and Control servers.
0.4354725695597483 In October when Kaspersky Lab took over an Icefog domain called lingdona[.]com (which expired in September 2013) hosted in Hong Kong, it matched other known Icefog domains and first analysis revealed that it began receiving connections every 10 seconds from a Javafog, a new turn since other variants used IE User-Agent strings.
0.56799335651186 It's possible that Javafog was developed for a US-specific operation, one that was designed to be longer than the typical Icefog attacks.
0.4467750720930656 Kaspersky Lab has identified another Chinese APT campaign, dubbed 'Icefog', who targeted Governmental institutions, Military contractors, maritime / shipbuilding groups, telecom operators, industrial and high technology companies and mass media.
0.655002030953037 Kaspersky Lab itself has released reports on the Icefog attack campaign - which targeted military, shipping and other organizations in South Korea and Japan - and The Mask , an APT which hit victims in 31 countries.
0.323416524603987 Kaspersky Lab's research team originally characterized Icefog in an analysis as a "small yet energetic APT" focused on targets in South Korea and Japan that make up part of the supply chain for Western companies.
0.500776973646262 Kaspersky released a detailed report on the Icefog operations, its researchers localized and analyzed the command and control servers used by the attackers describing the techniques adopted, identifying the victims of the attacks and the information gathered.
0.1803541846322611 Remote code execution bugs in Windows (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2012-1856) spread via malicious Word or Excel files are the most common means of initiating the Icefog attack.
0.669256201570347 Researchers at Kaspersky Lab noted in uncovering Icefog that the attacks against the defense supply chain-including military contractors, ship builders, satellite operators, high tech companies and others in Japan and South Korea-were hit-and-run operations.
0.552020863806637 "The Icefog attackers effectively shut down their operations immediately following the research and report announcement," Baumgartner said. "Often, crews like this one just pop up later, and other groups are effectively deploying their techniques elsewhere."

0.087416739321890 "This could indicate a US-specific operation run by the Icefog attackers; one that was planned to take longer than usual, such as, for instance, long-term collection of intelligence on the target," they noted.
0.534101166216519 To date, Kaspersky Lab's Global Research and Analysis Team has observed six variants of Icefog and has been able to sinkhole 13 domains used in the attack, capturing snapshots of the malware used and logs detailing victims and interaction with command and control servers.
0.0788089107061483 "We can assume that based on their experience, the attackers found the Java backdoor to be more stealthy and harder to notice, making it more attractive for long term operations (most Icefog operations being very short - the hit-and-run type).".
0.56648373728898 As an added capability, Dridex can inject HTML as the bank websites are displayed to ask the user for extra information, such as their Social Security number or ATM PIN, at login.

0.2268093252181656 Citizen Lab first made waves in 2009 with "Tracking GhostNet," a report which exposed a vast electronic spying network that had compromised more than 1,200 computers in 103 countries, ensnaring Tibetan activists, embassies, media outlets, and many others.
0.1054958673821672 In March, a Mac backdoor that was part of the GhostNet campaign against non-governmental organizations supporting Tibet was found.
0.444573584136052 Other variants of it were used in the GhostNet attacks on governments, diplomatic missions and the private offices of the Dalai Lama in 2009.
0.336105438501298 Perhaps not quite as prolific as the notorious Comment Crew (aka APT 1), but Kaspersky Lab researchers claim that whoever launched NetTraveler is likely responsible for the Titan Rain and GhostNet attacks as well.
0.128999027360548 The report also cites a 2009 State Department cable that makes a connection between command and control servers involved in Byzantine Hades, and servers identified in advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks dubbed "Ghostnet" that were documented by researchers at the University of Toronto that targeted the Tibetan government in exile.
0.656733983934076 Those attacks employed similar tactics to the current Mac attacks and used a Java exploit and researchers said they might have been tied to the same group that initiated the infamous GhostNet attacks several years ago.
0.0694542292139187 The report can be read (PDF) in one of two ways: either as a primer on the operation and capabilities of both the gh0st RAT tool and the GhostNet network, or as an intelligence document detailing (with some redactions) where GhostNet infections were found and, perhaps more importantly, where the espionage network's C&C servers appear to be located.
0.431812794942747 Dubbed " Mumblehard " by ESET researchers, the malware targets Linux and BSD OSes and has two components -- a backdoor and a spam daemon.
0.274730510828428 ESET Researchers were able to monitor the Mumblehard backdoor component by registering a domain name used as one of the C&C servers.
0.557722730564113 In the last seven months, several thousand Linux and FreeBSD machines have been infected with a sophisticated malware dubbed Mumblehard.
0.74114071464024 Researchers have logged more than 8,500 unique IP addresses during the seven months period of research that were hit by Mumblehard Linux malware and found over 3,000 machines joined them in the past three weeks.
0.475415124917729 Researchers sinkholed the backdoor and, starting in Sept. 2014, collected seven months' worth of data, identifying nearly 8,900 unique IP addresses with Mumblehard behavior.
0.749233827227221 The researchers believe that Mumblehard is also installed on servers compromised via Joomla and Wordpress exploits, and have urged administrators to check whether their servers have been hit: "Victims should look for unsolicited cronjob entries for all the users on their servers.
0.706422173196976 EquationDrug, the main platform that has been used by the nation-state cyber-espionage actor Equation Group, has been in use for more than 10 years-but a fresh analysis from Kaspersky Lab shows that its evolution exemplifies an emerging trend.
0.588614415575182 Kaspersky experts analyzed 30 different modules, among the capabilities implemented by the EquationDrug there were system-level functions, data exfiltration modules for specific targets,
0.759998098483701 Kaspersky Lab--which last month disclosed its findings on the highly advanced and well-funded nation-state --today published new details of the so-called EquationDrug software platform used by the group over the past 10 years.
0.706655818606860 Kaspersky's study of EquationDrug illustrates how nation-states like the Equation Group constantly up the ante in their code, the researchers say in their new report .
0.3320321903393077 "Some code paths in EquationDrug modules lead to OS version checks including a test for Windows 95, which is accepted as one of the supported platforms," the firm said.
0.59141853636063 Speaking of plug-ins, Kaspersky Lab today said it has found some 30 plug-ins for EquationDrug thus far, but there could be some 90 additional ones as well.
0.3558433613920566 Statistics based on compilation time stamps found in the EquationDrug samples collected so far suggest that its developers are working almost exclusively from Monday to Friday and are likely located in the UTC-3 or UTC-4 time zones, if we assume that they start work at 8 or 9 am.
0.668022135787000 The experts at Kaspersky Lab analyzed code artifacts and timestamps related to the EquationDrug, they speculate that coders are native English speakers that worked a Monday through Friday 9-5 work week in the UTC-3 or UTC-4 time zone.
0.69260697628111 The report includes the names of some the attack tools and malware the Equation group used, including EquationLaser, EquationDrug, DoubleFantasy, TripleFantasy, Fanny and GrayFish.
0.514143082111607 "A recent detection name that has been used in relation to this botnet is 'Mevade.A', but older references suggest the name 'Sefnit', which dates back to at least 2009 and also included Tor connectivity.
0.603777016184758 Facebook's security team also has found at least two update mechanisms to Sefnit that don't employ SSH and use different C&C servers, according to a Facebook spokesperson.
0.483557249860408 In Sefnit's case, the 600 percent increase in Tor usage it kicked off was also its downfall as Tor administrators noticed performance issues and steps were taken to strangle its activity.
0.286449293888155 In September, researchers identified the major reason of increased Tor users i.e. A Tor-based botnet called ' Sefnit malware ', which was infecting millions of computers for click fraud and bitcoin mining.
0.54336748691 Microsoft experts remarked that Sefnit malware silently installed a Tor client on infected machines, even if it is removed the Tor service will be left and still regularly connect to the Tor Network.
0.369215770184164 Microsoft reports a rash of new click-fraud activity linked to the Sefnit malware, which was thought dead and buried as of 2011, Microsoft Malware Protection Center researcher Geoff McDonald wrote in a blogpost this week.

0.592337232729349 The malware in question was already detected by our products as Sefnit-FAT, but the true content of the malware couldn't be replicated in our environment no matter what we did.
0.1720081755945216 The Mevade Botnet , which was first discovered by Microsoft in July of this year, is believed to be a variant of the malware Sefnit, which has been used by adversaries as far back as 2011.
0.367662469591021 ' The security problem lies in the fact that during a Sefnit component infection, the Tor client service is also silently installed in the background.
0.3454109960133955 The Sefnit removal according Microsoft requests the execution of a specific procedures hard to explain to its customers, that's why Microsoft decided to remotely erase every component belonging to the botnet .
0.559343079603571 The Tor client service had a specific configuration that Microsoft identified, and despite some concerns that Microsoft was overstepping by possibly snaring some versions of Tor legitimately installed by users, the cleanup moved forward and Sefnit numbers dwindled.
0.0564470214051369 This new, stealthier methodology is believed to be largely responsible for Sefnit being able to evade AV vendor detection during the last couple of years," he continued.

0.1841180337888472 As explained in the report the hacker behind Casper had access to two zero-day exploits that were used in an instance detected in April 2014.
0.756062246102589 Casper did not contain any clues that would point to a French origin, but the use of zero-day exploits indicates that it was created by a powerful organization, they said.

The same code is present in some NBOT samples," she added."None of these signs alone is enough to establish a strong link but all the shared features together make us assess with high confidence that Bunny, Babar, NBOT and Casper were all developed by the same organization."
0.1978193211425266 Casper is a "well-developed reconnaissance tool" with several features designed specifically to remain hidden on victim machines and outsmart anti-virus products, according to Eset analyst Joan Calvet.

0.04817242002633781 Casper is so called reconnaissance malware, used to spy information about software and hardware configuration of an infected system.
0.443614713103308 Casper surveillance malware was used as an initial program before deploying any advance persistent malware into the targeted computers for espionage purpose.
0.507051178935954 Correlation of threat data made it possible to determine links between Nbot, Bunny, Babar and malware samples collected from watering hole attack in Syria in April 2014 - which happened to be the Casper strain.
0.1410069642546454 Development of targeted malware with a level of sophistication shown by Casper requires a skilled team of developers; also the use of 0-day exploits in the distribution process leaves the conclusion the operators were very well funded.
0.3020954560698484 It is believed that Casper surveillance malware is created by experts with significant financial resources i.e. State-sponsored.
0.288888724097512 "None of these signs alone is enough to establish a strong link but all the shared features together make us assess with high confidence that Bunny, Babar, NBOT and Casper were all developed by the same organization.".
0.510210570592593 Now, security experts have spotted a new malware, dubbed Casper, which is a spyware designed to track Internet users for surveillance purpose.
0.685811656657650 On the second-to-last Monday of 2010, Brian Byrd was playing video poker on his Dell Inspiron laptop when someone knocked on the door of his home in Casper, Wyoming.
0.4421136466290417 Researchers from several antivirus companies have found links between the malware programs, which they call Babar, Bunny, Casper, Dino, NBot and Tafacalou.
0.775646684964666 "The Byrd's were upset that their privacy had been intruded on and someone was likely looking at C. Byrd while she was undressed," a Casper Police officer identified as L. Starnes wrote in the report.
0.321774210379948 The report analyzed by Motherboard revealed that Casper was designed by a French hacking group, linked to the French government, to conduct several espionage campaigns over the last few years.
0.2316697016117964 Apple has downplayed the impact of the attacks by the Mac Defender rogue antivirus family, but anecdotal evidence from Apple Store Geniuses suggests the problem is widespread .

0.132718069259882 And now, there's renewed concern that a malware attack will target the agency and inflict a level of damage that similar or worse to that caused last year by Shamoon , which destroyed data on about 30,000 computers and servers at Aramco, the Saudi Arabian national oil and natural gas company.
0.781423576543544 Arab Energy Firms In September 2012, at the same time that U.S financial institutions were under attack, the so-called "Shamoon Virus" also besieged Arab energy firms in multiple Arab states allied with America.
0.495349341630008 Attackers famously used the Shamoon malware to target Saudi Arabia-based oil firm Saudi Aramco in 2012, which crippled tens of thousands of systems at the company by destroying MBRs after stealing valuable data.
0.712162415341074 Aviv Raff, CTO of Seculert, who analyzed samples of Shamoon, said that the proxy server he saw being used is not one of the compromised machines included in a list posted last on week on Pastebin.
0.1188017768635624 Back in 2012, the experts in Seculert's Research Lab discovered Shamoon : a new type of malware that attacked Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian national oil and natural gas company, and ended up destroying data on about 30,000 computers and servers.
0.672758826969129 "Because of the highly destructive functionality of the Shamoon 'Wiper' module, an organization infected with the malware could experience operational impacts including loss of intellectual property (IP) and disruption of critical systems," ICS-CERT warned.
0.1610379634988465 But given that the attack relied on a commercial software component to delete data that was previously used in the Shamoon attack on Saudi Aramco-an attack that was initially attributed to Iran-the assertion seems tenuous without specific additional details.
0.2165362290628235 But other than its function, the malware used in the South Korea attacks bears no resemblance to Shamoon or other viruses that have been used in "cyberwar" attacks.

0.062869266262956 In 2012, Kaspersky documented a case known as Wiper that destroyed data as well as Shamoon (see Seculert's analysis too) which targeted oil companies in the Middle East and destroyed data and is believed to be the malware that was used to damage thousands computers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar .
0.3655055453058113 In its wake, Shamoon destroyed data on about 30,000 of Aramco's computers and servers, and inflicted a massive amount of damage and chaos that is still reverberating today.

0.753237169140837 Many hypothesis have been proposed, some experts are sure that Shamoon is a new state sponsored malware for cyber espionage that is also able to destroy the victims maybe to hide its operations deleting every evidence that can link the clients to Command & Control servers, other researchers believe that we are facing with a true cyber weapon that have to be spread inside specific networks with the dual intent to gather information and destroy the enemy pcs.
0.528209212927687 Most insightfully, however, Boyce highlighted an essential point that that should be heeded by governments and organizations the world over: traditional antivirus systems and defenses like firewalls and intrusion prevention cannot prevent 100% of fast-spreading viruses like Shamoon, which are designed to spread internally.
0.627495403949100 No one know the hacker groups, they could be competitors or state sponsored hackers , it's hard to understand it, but what is interesting is the concomitance with another strange event I described in a past post, the discovery of the malware Shamoon that has been used also to attack companies in the energy sector.

0.503842243496979 Previous analysis of the malware that brought down Sony Pictures' network showed that there were marked similarities to the tools used in last year's cyber-attack on South Korean media companies and the 2012 "Shamoon" attack on Saudi Aramco.

0.4979766296758838 The attack used a computer virus known as Shamoon , spread through Aramco's network and wiped computers' hard drives clean.
0.4456393932395150 The intent of the attackers behind the Shamoon malware isn't too clear at this point, but the tool is collecting data from infected machines and sending off to parts unknown.
0.592528745577946 "The IP address (10.1.252.19) of the proxy server, in the Shamoon samples that Seculert analyzed, is not part of the list described in the pastes," Raff said.
0.650676458791991 The malware portion of the cyber-attack that has been uncovered thus far by investigators was a "wiper"-a strain of a Windows trojan that was identified by Sophos as malware it had discovered over a year ago-similar in behavior to part of the Shamoon virus that attacked energy companies in the Middle East last summer.
0.2405194184012915 The researcher of Seculert who analyzed the malware have also discovered that it has also the ability to overwrite the machine's MBR, what is interesting is that before Shamoon make unusable the pc it gathers data from the victim, it steals information, taking data from the 'Users', 'Documents and Settings', and 'System32/Drivers' and 'System32/Config' folders on Windows computers, and send them to another infected PC on the same internal network, the reason of this strange procedure is still a mystery.
0.593953251939120 There have been persistent media reports that the Shamoon wiper malware we previously covered is linked to attacks against Saudi Aramco.

0.76821924897419 We will continue to monitor the threat landscape for possible damage that the recent changes in the Nuclear Exploit Kit may bring.
0.4135696802086251 The malware's code includes references to a Java class called Cryptor, suggesting that Svpeng might start encrypting files in the future, a technique increasingly used by ransomware threats for both Windows and Android.
0.650209365814154 A new variation of the aforementioned Svpeng Trojan uses several tricks to phish for credit card numbers and online banking credentials.
0.2749027984271622 A number of suspects believed to be responsible for one of the first major banking malware threats - known as Svpeng - were arrested in Russia last month .
0.62418358704477 After this, the cybercriminal can instruct Svpeng to transfer money from the victim's bank account to the mobile phone account associated with it.
0.368225492150134 At the beginning of the year, a new modification of Svpeng emerged with ransomware capabilities.
0.461060100326201 By the end of the second quarter we had managed to find 64 versions of the new Svpeng.
0.2357091605987088 Cohen points to Svpeng , mobile ransomware identified by security firm Kaspersky Labs in summer 2014, as an example of the kind of threat that will become more common this year.
0.272082436281372 Earlier versions of Svpeng impacted mobile users in Russia, stealing card details from customers of major banks.
0.391282750749029 For example, Svpeng uses a previously unknown vulnerability to protect itself from being removed manually or by the antivirus program.
0.05506105209499212 However, a recently discovered banking Trojan named "Svpeng" may be the one to wake companies and users out of their collective security slumbers.
0.588484297404250 In July the same Svpeng ransomware began targeting mainly US Android users and, according to the experts at Kaspersky Lab, other victims were observed in UK, Switzerland, Germany, India and Russia.
0.698548471291273 It's a question of time, a new variant of Svpeng will target also many other bank apps.
0.612230433633833 It's unlikely that this is the end of the story for Svpeng's evolution, however.
0.783932377888925 One example is the Svpeng Trojan, which was discovered by Kaspersky Lab experts in July 2013.
0.128201183786354 Originating in Russia, Svpeng has crossed the ocean and taken on a dangerous pattern beyond other forms of mobile ransomware I have discussed before.
0.4745720161912 Svpeng has been found to target Russian banks so far, but could easily spread to others if the malware is a success.
0.262937735961075 SVPENG is a PC-grade mobile malware that infects users by disguising itself as an Adobe Flash Player update.
0.040410216566499 Svpeng would wait until the user opened an online banking
0.0955217553530152 "Svpeng would wait until the user opened an online banking app and then replace it with its own in an attempt to obtain the victim's login and password," explained Roman Unuchek, Kaspersky Lab expert, in an analysis . "The Trojan also attempted to steal bank card details by displaying its own window on top of the Google Play app and requesting the information the criminals wanted."
0.621974283491053 The first version of the Svpeng mobile malware, which has Trojan-ransom capability, was detected at the beginning of 2014.
0.0573522840839693 This enables the owner of Svpeng to find out whether any cards issued by these banks are associated with the infected smartphone's number and to get balance information if an account exists.
0.556624126925081 This rising trend was led by two other programs targeting online banking users - Svpeng and Marcher.
0.3072360226623710 This version of Svpeng completely blocks the mobile device so that the user can not even access the switch off/reboot menu.
0.624243920747694 We managed to identify seven modifications of the new Svpeng, and all of them include a Cryptor class reference, but none of them makes any attempt to use it.
0.2639841175914744 Yes, SVPENG is quickly spreading throughout the U.S. and Europe, targeting data that holds banking credentials, credit card data and personal information.
0.745711244972504 No matter that it looks similarly to CryptoWall virus or Kovter ransomware , it seems that its appearance has nothing to do with malware.

0.0724551992974488 A new version of the file-encrypting CryptoWall ransomware has emerged, and it has Tor and Invisible Internet Project (I2P) in tow.
0.58270805319626 Additional variants observed in 2014 included CryptoDefense and Cryptowall, which are also considered destructive.
0.339261722885799 Adobe may have already patched a Flash Player vulnerability last week, but several users-especially those in the US, Canada, and the UK -are still currently exposed and are at risk of getting infected with CryptoWall 3.0.
0.447678968474388 After compromising the user with a malicious Flash file or other exploit, the user is served a variant of Cryptowall.
0.335851703503610 AlphaCrypt is a recent variant that uses threat notifications like its predecessor TeslaCrypt and employs an encryption (recovery) key technique like Cryptowall 3.0 but defeats shadow volume measures and executes more stealthily.
0.4738230735704801 Also, most of RIG's usage is for distributing Cryptowall, the latest ransomware to follow the now-infamous CryptoLocker's practice of using a key-based encryption system to hold victim data hostage.
0.334129627788105 Although Cryptolocker has been largely disabled, Cryptowall and other forms of ransomware are spreading to multiple vectors.
0.597797108172348 Although CryptoWall uses the WinINet application programming interface (API) to perform network functions, the malware ignores the system's configured proxy server and instead communicates directly with its C2 servers.
0.346663233831859 Although there are several copycat strains of malware - including CryptoWall, CryptoDefense and OnionLocker - CryptoLocker has by far the largest "market share" among them.

0.711462806138203 And given how much effort the people behind CryptoWall have put into this new release, there's sure to be another one dropping some time soon to leapfrog malware detection systems again.
0.392346903894503 And like many modern pieces of malware, CryptoWall 2.0 has a virtual machine check in its code that disables the attack when the malware is installed within a virtual instance-in part to prevent security researchers from isolating and analyzing its behavior.
0.2964714939522592 And like professional software developers, the CryptoWall author(s) seem to believe in first testing new versions thoroughly alongside previous versions before completely switching over to the new one.
0.4511484934278938 And perhaps as a "precautionary measure," CryptoWall 3.0 deletes the system's shadow copies to disable restoring files to their previous state, rendering victims with no other options for saving their files.
0.308122295188053 Another program, called Cryptowall, generated over $1 million in ransom payments during a six-month period in 2014.
0.168150400494288 As a result, another improved ransomware packages have sprung up to replace it - CryptoWall .
0.744247327312052 Based on feedback from the Smart Protection Network, the region most affected by CryptoWall 3.0 is Australia/New Zealand, followed by North America and Europe.
0.637527812199123 Based on post-mortem data collected by researchers, CryptoWall has been less effective at producing income than CryptoLocker.
0.526798533587082 Both malware families accepted payments via Bitcoin, with 0.27% of CryptoWall victims and 0.21% of CryptoLocker victims paying ransoms in bitcoins.
0.184334544576290 By the time you see this message, the CryptoWall malware has already encrypted your files and - unless you have a clean backup - you probably won't be able to get your files back without paying up.
0.399326306556173 CryptoLocker is perhaps the most notorious piece of ransomware, but Cryptowall is catching up fast.

0.630166812042013 CryptoWall has encrypted 5.25 billion files.
0.3917424832547692 CryptoWall has surpassed CryptoLocker in infection rates.

0.1546496135821362 As was the case with Thunderstrike, Vilaca said he doesn't think his attack is likely to be exploited on a mass scale.
0.646387130244837 At the Chaos Communication Congress in Germany late last month, reverse engineer Trammell Hudson discussed on a proof-of-concept exploit dubbed " Thunderstrike " that gives attackers control of OS X -based devices.
0.4695562398343652 Earlier this month, Thunderstrike creator Trammell Hudson said that only the latest versions of Mac Mini's and iMac Retina 5ks were largely immune to the exploit but that Apple engineers were in the process of developing a fix for the rest of the Mac product line.
0.636119717448373 Hudson said Apple is in the process of partially patching the vulnerabilities that make Thunderstrike possible.
0.765492703394039 Hudson said he's still waiting on the publication of CVE-2014-4498, the vulnerability designation assigned to the Thunderstrike hole.

0.565748879099571 A botnet known as Nitol, built on the backs of PCs and laptops loaded with malware somewhere in the supply chain, was taken down by Microsoft.
0.3854730734632487 After looking into whether pirated copies of Windows were making their way onto PCs in the production process in China, the discovery of pre-installed malware prompted a legal action and technical offensive that Microsoft codenamed Operation b70, targeted at cutting off Nitol and other malware at its host..
0.60993621863305 But it is not clear how effective this action will be at blocking that activity, or more than temporarily disrupting Nitol's operations.
0.1105185052256482 Further digging revealed the 3322.org domain and sub-domains hosting not only Nitol but more than 500 different pieces of malware.

0.784939924932814 Microsoft began looking into the Nitol botnet more than a year ago after buying 20 laptops in China and discovering that some of them had been pre-loaded with the Nitol malware, as well as a few other pieces of malicious software.
0.625867488107591 Microsoft found similar DDoS behavior in all the Nitol variants, despite some other variations.
0.2633937546016429 "Microsoft is fully committed to protecting consumers by combating the distribution of counterfeit software and working closely with governments, law enforcement and other industry members in these efforts. Our disruption of the Nitol botnet further demonstrates our resolve to take all necessary steps to protect our customers and discourage criminals from defrauding them into using malware infected counterfeit software," says Boscovich..
0.471119278590301 Microsoft said it sought to disrupt a counterfeit supply-chain operation that sold knockoff versions of Windows PCs that came pre-loaded with a strain of malware called " Nitol ," which lets attackers control the systems from afar for a variety of nefarious purposes.
0.05875806938708838 Microsoft said there is no evidence they were created by the same author, though all originate in China it would seem as 85 percent of Nitol infections have been detected in China, compared to close to 10 percent in the U.S. Eighty percent of command and control servers were also located in China, with 15 percent in the U.S..

0.577015047802771 For those readers who have hung around the security and vulnerability research fields for a while, all that sounds strangely familiar: its Microsoft circa 2000, just as worms like Code Red, Nimda and Slammer would knock the company off its perch and force it to address security head on and wipe away the opaque and inwardly-focused engineering culture that often left customers and the public fuming over the poor handling of security incidents and malware outbreaks.
0.782912216758166 Gates fired off his Trustworthy Computing memo to employees on Jan. 15, 2002, amid a series of high-profile attacks on Windows computers and browsers in the form of worms and viruses like Code Red and "Anna Kournikova."
0.79072873104828 In the past two decades we have seen several other pieces of malware rise to media prominence, and in the early 2000s it seemed to become an annual event, with worms such as ILOVEYOU [20], Code Red [21], Blaster [22] and SQL Slammer [23] spreading so quickly they caused problems with email, database and web servers, not to mention home computers.
0.0918423621149586 Less than a month later, Code Red arrived, exploiting that same vulnerability to spread from Web server to Web server.
0.0407049482121366 Nimda didn't propagate as quickly as Code Red, but it was difficult to eradicate from affected networks.
0.257531184557040 The cyber security threat landscape has changed fundamentally over the last decade from "Code Red" to mass espionage and the threat of kinetic damage.
0.4171211270848541 The first worm that spread without requiring any user interaction at all and thus spread around the world in minutes, Code Red hid from detection and carried out various functions on a cycle.
0.739386882772281 While we can hope that personal firewalls and NAT systems will prevent any kind of Code Red or Nimda-style self-propagating worm from infecting these systems, exploitation through the likes of malicious e-mail attachments, Office documents, USB keys, and browsers is inevitable.
0.76959518284203 Initially, the malware used in the attack was reported to be ZxShell (aka Sensocode), a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
0.4670973593667564 WCSH-TV reported that Sheriff Todd Brackett of Lincoln County admitted somebody on the network had accidentally downloaded a "Megacode" virus (which a questioner on a BleepingComputer discussion forum described as being "Like Cryptolocker , but not as well done").
0.692572330040436 Although this makes the term even more useless in conversations intended to characterize the specifics of an attack, it has been something I've argued for quite some time now and was my initial thought when news of Edward Snowden's escapades (and, specifically, XKeyscore, FoxAcid, et al.) broke.

0.2350077937150323 FoxAcid matches vulnerabilities found on a particular compromised system with any number of attacks available at the NSA's disposal.
0.0841623398588748 FoxAcid, on the other hand, is alleged to be a sophisticated analogy to Metasploit's browser_autopwn, which attempts to fingerprint a Web browser's attack surface and serve up appropriate conditional content to exploit client-side vulnerabilities, whether they be in the browser itself or a plugin (such as Flash, Java etc).
0.3691661577551852 Governments interested in surveillance have had limited success, for example, in breaking Tor and watching users' communication over that network through the spy agency's FoxAcid program and Quantam servers.
0.2677070503960621 "Here are the FoxAcid basics: By the time the NSA tricks a target into visiting one of those servers, it already knows exactly who that target is, who wants him eavesdropped on, and the expected value of the data it hopes to receive.
0.581566997565953 It's unclear whether the GCHQ has its own version of FoxAcid or whether it just piggybacks on the NSA's servers as per their unique surveillance cooperation relationship.
0.647444509758254 Recent reports have disclosed that the NSA uses a fleet of high-latency -- codenamed "Quantum" -- servers to redirect targeted systems to another fleet of servers, codenamed "FoxAcid," that launch tailored drive-by attacks.
0.1449818513903179 Schneier said FoxAcid was a general system operated under the NSA's computer network exploitation program and is used for many types of attacks other than the Tor attacks described in his analysis.
0.367468353906651 The attacks hypothesized by the President Correa are plausible if we consider the revelations made by the whistleblower Edward Snowden that in different documents refers of an intense activity of the NSA in the surveillance of exponents of foreign government thanks to sophisticated hacking platforms like the FoxAcid servers.
0.1566932971517629 The FoxAcid system was also used to track individuals into the anonymizing Tor network .
0.735515706222419 The highly overt, shotgun approach used by many groups of Chinese-based adversaries -- attempting to compromise targets in every which way possible -- is surely a world away from the manner in which technologies such as FoxAcid have been deployed in the past.

0.54591370815433 "To trick targets into visiting a FoxAcid server, the NSA relies on its secret partnerships with US telecoms companies.
0.6853456706876 Due to its structure, its method of operation, and the professional approach used in programming it, Regin bears the hallmarks of having been created and used by an organised, well-funded operation, probably for the purpose of espionage and surveillance, Symantec security operations manager Orla Cox told TechNewsWorld .While it is likely authored by a government-sponsored group, Symantec does not have any evidence that would link the creation and use of Regin to a particular state or state agency.

0.1751265961951056 4.1 deployment and startup At the time of writing, it is not known how the Regin 64-bit samples are deployed to target systems; our analysis of the sample's interactions with the system show that the the sample is no different from any other Dynamic Link Library.
0.2212746831562647 6 stages of Regin There are six stages: The first driver is the only visible piece of the attack on the infected machine -- the next five stages of the attack are encrypted.
0.1283412532745065 A Symantec white paper reveals details about Regin, a spying malware of unusual complexity which is believed to be state-sponsored.
0.25337302363701 According to the experts, the development of the Regin platform requested a significant effort, its level of complexity led the research to believe that it was a product of a nation-state project.
0.4842269771258842 Additionally, documents leaked by Edward Snowden show that the National Security Agency employed Regin as a means of conducting surveillance on European Union computer systems .
0.475074771760462 After comparing the released code with its own findings on Regin, analysts at Kaspersky concluded that the malware developers of QWERTY and Regin are one and the same, or at least working together, a Tuesday blog post revealed .
0.518566732918106 All of this supports us in confirming our suspicion that the authors of Regin are skilled developers, experienced in the ways of software design and implementation.
0.2811609752070104 Also in this case Regin has a modular structure that make the malware a very flexible agent that could be used by operators to tailor campaign to individual targets, the effort necessary for its development appears significant, the experts speculates that it required months or years to be completed.
0.780090266328987 Although Kaspersky Lab falls short of attribution, this tie-in to Stuxnet and Flame, as well as the group's use of virtual file systems similar to those found in Regin, and many other links, make the United States National Security Agency a prime suspect.
0.4097493807845078 Although researchers and software vendors didn't fully realize what they were dealing with until recently, Regin malware definitions have been available for some time now.
0.0841370450626538 Anti-virus firms have been defending the timing of their disclosure of the technical capabilities of powerful Regin espionage malware .
0.2350597371782440 Attempting attribution based on this single component is particularly challenging, as Regin's stage #1 is purely 2.14 invocation of stage #2 a support module, with very little content other than With the payload fully mapped into memory and the executable code.
0.750490212691231 Back in November, analysts identified that Regin was likely used for intelligence gathering by a nation-state, and that attackers' exploits with the tool dated back to 2008.
0.1970343739101659 But it wasn't until this week that all three firms released related reports, saying Regin's code complexity and attack sophistication means it is likely the work of a state-sponsored attacker.
0.1001662442879319 But the reason Regin is only gaining attention now, F-Secure security advisor Sean Sullivan says, has to do with its "excellent OPSEC," referring to military jargon for "operational security.".
0.790059693691250 By technically addressing the programmatic and economic side of the malware development lifecycle, Regin represents a leap forward in sophistication, planning, and effectiveness.
0.0949232203235869 Consensus in the industry is that Regin was created by a nation-state for the purpose of cyberespionage.
0.167461231700190 Considering the significant capabilities of their fellow nation-state actors that were behind breakthroughs such as the Stuxnet worm and possibly the Regin cyberespionage software, governments have to take the APT prospect seriously, especially since incidents with the State Department, U.S. Postal Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may have involved state-sponsored action.
0.1984214807947345 Conspicuously missing as victims of Regin are residents of the US as well as many Western European countries including the UK, but neither Symantec nor Kaspersky would confirm who might be behind Regin.
0.1271802807998906 Evaluating how to defend against Regin -- or other advanced threats -- in the future could help prioritize resources for defending the enterprise.
0.0520257629105104 Even so, researchers are still not yet sure just how Regin infects the machines initially.
0.335845391624071 First there was Stuxnet and Flame, and now there's an even more sophisticated, stealthy, and powerful cyber espionage attack called Regin that dates back as far as 2003 and has been found infecting machines in more than a dozen countries.
0.518580803559277 Given the fact that it also follows a modular approach and possesses an array of anti-forensic capabilities, Regin is thought to be on a level of sophistication on par with Stuxnet, according to Symantec.
0.094115334901933 Given the sophistication of the Regin attackers, Raiu said that it is unlikely they will abandon these operations anytime soon - though they might "wait for the buzz to dissipate then come with new tools or tactics" to target organizations.
0.574504544067116 He later added that, of the Regin infections which span 27 organizations in 14 countries, the Legspin module was deployed in only one attack.
0.723259230957249 However, the link between QWERTY and Regin suggests that the cyber espionage malware platform, security researchers call Regin, is none other than WARRIORPRIDE.
0.25306262313909 If no suitable code segment, relative to the instruction after the jmp location is available, Regin's stage #1 will simply terminate its execution.
0.0695808084287 If Regin was written by conventional cybercriminals it would seem strange for them to avoid such potential rich targets.
0.295198773733294 In 12 cases (44% of samples), the decoy names used of a set of 27 32-bit samples of Regin's stage #1 component.
0.234782665565848 In the case of the "augmented" samples, trampoline mechanism set up to mask the malware's access the benign device driver used as a base offers little to to external subroutines, Regin's stage #1 is ready to transfer nothing in terms of information that could help identifying control to the next stage.
0.351293314239726 In the past two days, information regarding a highly targeted campaign known as 'Regin' has been publicly disclosed.
0.4866286191258921 Information about Regin first became public when Symantec released its November 2014 report, which offered the first-ever detailed technical analysis of the malware.
0.1288230187244996 is successful, the malware retrieves the value of the Given the number of times Regin's stage #1 needs to retrieve SizeOfImage field from the OptionalHeader of the PE file, PE-related information, this subroutine is a great help in then allocates a number of bytes equivalent to this value.
0.74945236056948 It is added, for example, to the y 0x99119911: not specifically replaced, but parts of it are payload's data directory information and it is used for most overwritten with the address of post-API-call code if the of the computations performed by Regin's stage #1.
0.3288888229918909 It resurfaced in 2013 (Regin 2.0) with some significant differences: the new version is 64-bit, and may have lost a stage.
0.2514418101091827 It's ironic that the recent news by Symantec threat research team to find Regin malware spying on businesses also indicates that it's been on systems for over six years.
0.596474537220667 Kaspersky Lab found that in April 2008, the attackers behind Regin captured administrative login credentials that would let them "manipulate" a GSM network in a Middle Eastern country, the name of which the researchers would not disclose.
0.586090761148365 Kaspersky Lab says it first began to hear about Regin in the spring of 2012, when it was tipped off to malware that resembled Duqu .
0.3327133027708808 Kaspersky researchers Raiu and Soumenkov confirmed that the QWERTY malware is identical in functionality to a specific Regin plugin.
0.597512322525982 KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT -- Cancun, Mexico -- Move over Stuxnet, Flame, and Regin: A newly uncovered cyber espionage operation that predates and rivals Stuxnet has been underway since at least 2001, armed with advanced tools and techniques that include hacking air gapped computers and a first: silently reprogramming victims' hard drives such that malware can't be detected or erased.
0.772009170448589 "Legspin is quite rare and we've seen just one instance where this backdoor was used [by Regin's operators]," Raiu said.
0.660832488139721 Less than 48 hours after warnings first surfaced about powerful espionage malware called "Regin" - also known as "Regis" - debate continues to rage over who's been running the related attack campaigns, for what purpose, and if anti-virus vendors should have sounded related alerts more quickly (see Espionage Malware Alert Sounded ).
0.153607362849447 MAlwARe AnAlysis In this section we will detail the results of the analysis of Regin's 64-bit stage #1 component.

0.178419722524957 Malware researchers at Kaspersky Lab have uncovered a link between the Regin malware platform and the attack platform cited in the last collection of document published by Edward Snowden to Der Spiegel magazine .
0.656429698889305 McAfee products detected and protected against Regin malware samples mentioned in the report since 2011.
0.4565658900465272 Mika told me that some confidential sources from an important Antivirus vendor, revealed that they have discovered traces of Regin in 2003, in 2005, e and after 2005 it disappeared.
0.696174581282962 Moreover, the researchers also found that both QWERTY and the 50251 plug-in depend on a different module of the Regin platform identified as 50225 which relies on kernel hooking functions.
0.326031520368103 Near as we can tell, all the companies had added signatures for Regin to their detection database long before last month.
0.367083918514708 No country has taken credit for Regin, but there's substantial evidence that it was built and operated by the United States.
0.55260171285168 One of the key aspects of Regin is that it appears to have knowledge of the target environment and vulnerabilities in that environment that could be exploited.
0.0489327668868914 Our analysis of the Regin's stage #1, as detailed in this A suitable DATA_DIRECTORY is one which satisfies the document, shows that this component of the Regin following conditions: framework is designed to retrieve an additional payload (stage #2) from an already compromised system, map it into y The particular data directory is not in use kernel memory and execute it.
0.3064765439304323 Payload continues its operations Import resolution is the crucial part for achieving Regin In the following subsections we will discuss the details stage #1's goal of hiding the originator of system calls of how the malware retrieves and pieces together all the from external observers.
0.2156924464378461 Perhaps more importantly, we know that Regin has been used to attack many low-end systems, presumably to gather sufficient information to go after higher-profile targets.
0.787032898073539 Rather than operate as a standalone, QWERTY can only work via kernel hooking functions provided by the Regin module 50225.
0.688377159403311 Regardless, Regin remains a powerful spying platform wielded by one or more nation states and can't be taken lightly, even if protections are currently available in a number of anti-malware products.
0.563637901197240 Regin is a 'back door-type' Trojan which is customizable depending on the target and is encrypted at each stage to avoid detection, according to Symantec .
0.518602992185853 Regin is an advanced persistent threat that loads its attack modules into a PC's registry - its name is a reversal of "in [the] registry" - via a six-stage attack, multiple security experts say.
0.730281508644353 Regin tool has also been linked to hacks which targeted the International Atomic Energy Agency based in Austria and the 2011 attack on European Commission computers, Spiegel said.
0.2991164169324068 Regin uses all of these different capabilities in six different stages, as outlined by Symantec on its blog:
0.608813853333985 Regin was designed mainly for two objectives, the intelligence gathering and the facilitating other further attacks on the targeted systems.
0.486852941121335 Regin's stage #1 malware samples contain a happens completely in kernel mode, we can speculate that hardcoded registry path and value name to be used as a fall- the authors of this threat are skilled and well-funded.
0.2213704306699709 Researchers have recently determined that cyberespionage software referenced in Edward Snowden's leaked documents was, in fact Regin and, while it hasn't appeared in the United States, has been used in Western Europe.
0.748234555127813 Researchers say they probably have only scratched the surface of Regin, and there likely are other variants and features yet to be discovered.
0.426860534585499 Researchers speculated that Regin shows a level of complexity greater than Flame and Duqu .
0.2038817007962476 Ronald Prins, Founder and CTO of Fox-IT, a company that was called in to analyze Belgacom's computer systems, is convinced Regin was developed by U.S. and UK intelligence agencies .
0.0465650218654307 So, if the suspicion that a state-sponsored actor is responsible for Regin is correct, who was it?
0.561006195036667 Some information security experts have criticized F-Secure, Kaspersky Lab and Symantec for not more quickly issuing public warnings about the malware, which experts say has sophisticated capabilities that rival those of Stuxnet and Flame (see Regin Espionage Malware: 8 Key Issues ).
0.1279438871467627 Some timestamps of files associated with Regin place the start of this attack was 2003, with other sources say it started in 2006, or somewhere between 2008 and 2011.
0.500108241121960 Soumenkov also provided advice to organizations aiming to defend themselves against the threat, particularly in light of new evidence linking Regin and QWERTY developers.
0.498174478031191 Soumenkov confirmed that the QWERTY malware is identical in functionality to a specific Regin plugin.
0.470578600175374 Sullivan says there may also be good reasons to not immediately disclose - at least publicly - in-depth details about malware such as Regin, including contractual agreements with customers.
0.1595442490440226 Symantec and other outlets have reported Regin malware samples from as far back as 2008, as well as antimalware definitions back to 2011.
0.60860991376660 "Symantec believes that many components of Regin remain undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist.
0.721545768023140 Symantec has uncovered the backdoor Regin, a highly advanced spying tool used in cyber espionage campaigns against governments and infrastructure operators.
0.791806658987491 Symantec researchers believe Regin was a sprawling framework that was used in multiple campaigns that data back to 2008 and possibly several years earlier.
0.538030563686953 Symantec was the first information security vendor to release a Regin report, on Nov. 23; anti-virus firms F-Secure and then Kaspersky Lab quickly followed suit.
0.637950053466646 Taking an architectural page from the SOA middleware book, Regin's creators have fundamentally altered threatscape economics.
0.553354943742400 The above images report side-by-side comparisons that demonstrate source code used by Regin and QWERTY are quite identical.
0.517426372213320 The evasion technique that allowed Regin backdoor to go undetected for years exploits a multi-staged process and each stage is hidden and encrypted.
0.1836611294988672 The experts have identified dozens of different payloads that are used to spy on the infected machine, the principal functions implemented by the authors of Regin include code for stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, capturing screenshots, seizing control of the target's mouse and recovering deleted files.
0.2646986486530923 The format of the string, specifically the 'WINDOWS' substring between angular brackets, is an indication of a strong connection between this sample and 32-bit samples of stage #1 of the complex threat named Regin; in fact, samples of Regin's 32-bit stage #1 used a similar format to mark strings that needed expansion.
0.277849355246011 The most recent reports , though not independently confirmed, suggest that the US and UK may have jointly developed Regin.
0.746572978609782 The Regin malware is used by threat actors to exfiltrate sensitive data and secrets from government agencies, banks, GSM telecom network operators and research institutions.
0.501458341193675 The Regin malware platform was disclosed in late November, it is considered by security experts, one of the most advanced cyber espionage tools.
0.0843175940854259 The researchers said that one piece of code in particular references plug-ins of the Regin platform and is used in QWERTY and its Regin counterpart.
0.540015890469894 The safe location involves an indirect jump structure is defined as follows: 2.10.4 trampolines Trampolines are the mechanism that Regin's stage #1 uses to reroute the execution through several pieces of code every time the payload executes a call to an external function.
0.143682060952173 "The security firm did not name a nation as the source of Regin, but is willing to say most of its victims were from Russia and Saudi Arabia and were targeted between 2008 and 2011 with a since decommissioned version of the malware that re-surfaced after 2013.".
0.617242549776104 The similarities with the 32-bit version of Regin's stage #1 are very strong, starting from the fact the two different versions of the malware have the same high level purpose, to the fact that they share code like the QuickPeParse subroutine and the string expansion functionalities.
0.1201200876745743 The sophisticated Regin malware raises new questions about the software we're using, says Tony Dyhouse.
0.3161595606897330 The techniques chosen by the creators of Regin appear to have been chosen to maximize its stealth features; this would allow an attacker to maintain a long-term presence on an affected system, which would be an effective tool for gathering stolen information.
0.29500632909568 "They contain the startup code that can be found in any other plugin of Regin, and include the actual plugin number that is registered within the platform to allow further addressing of the module.
0.615297034432570 This information changes my point of view and let me think that Regin is a probably a product of the Intelligence instead the cybercrime.
0.334970549532217 This particular aspect not only allows us to link together samples of the 32 and 64-bit version of Regin's stage #1 components, but also to mark the 64-bit version as the evolution of its 32-bit counterpart.
0.553720770434059 This week's In Case You Missed It looks at the five most popular articles on SC Mag UK this week including details of CESG-accredited cyber-security courses, the nation-state Regin malware and the latest Sony hack.
0.427815526423895 (VirtualAddress and Size must be 0) y The directory should not be among the following During the loading process, Regin's stage #1 will hide directories: the payload's invocations of function exported by other modules using an unusual 'trampoline' mechanism.
0.426440906886098 W64/Regin, Stage #1 5 Figure 2: Inspecting the certificate properties Figure 3: The certificate (left) does not follow the customary approach followed by Microsoft.
0.661660269720406 We also don't know what effect, if any, the widespread media coverage of Regin will have on further development by the states of origin or its ongoing use, but the nature of the spying (on private, industrial, infrastructural, and commercial interests) suggests that all organizations would do well to ensure comprehensive security protections.
0.47360456668715 We therefore believe that Regin's 64-bit stage #1 samples are installed and made persistend as any other Dynamic Link Library.
0.673930920809435 While a vast majority of enterprises will never need to defend against malware as advanced as Regin, Stuxnet or Flame, the most effective attack techniques from this malware will likely be adopted by malware authors for other varieties of malware, and therefore enterprises should be aware of them.
0.759392439518261 While almost half of the computers known to be infected by Regin were inside Internet service providers, Symantec believes they were attacked so the operators could spy on specific customers who used the ISPs.
0.4698458482375681 According to Malwarebytes security experts, the Angler Exploit Kit installs botnet malware for Bedep, a botnet that is able to load multiple payloads onto victim machines.
0.7925887244215 An exploit for a still officially unconfirmed zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player has been added to the popular Angler exploit kit and is, along with exploits for several other Flash flaws, opening users' Windows machines to the Bedep trojan.
0.727619496277128 Approximately two-thirds of the victims of BEDEP from November 2014 to February 2015 were located in the United States, with Japan making up most of the remainder.
0.4789584344395655 Bedep malware on the infected machines (normally Angler exploit kit uses Bedep in Flash player
0.593710151066866 Bedep was also linked to Flash Player attacks in late January exploiting CVE-2015-0311 , according to a blog post by Trend Micro research engineer Alvin Bacani.
0.792504272052404 Bedep's network activity has been documented in other security blogs here and here ; this blog's focus is more on the scope of malvertising and redirection activity involving the particular networks that lead to the Exploit Kits.
0.685321559462904 Cybercriminals are using the Angler exploit kit to infect users with the Bedep Trojan, which then uses their computer resources to perform click-fraud and artificially inflate video views.
0.0935118702291197 Despite that there is no visible GUI, Bedep loads malicious URLs that trigger the [exploit kit] exploitation.".
0.0995641136933340 FireEye's Dynamic Threat Intelligence captured a lot of Bedep referrer action over the past few months that confirmed the connection to malvertising activity and exploit kits, on top of the advertising click fraud that Bedep is known for.
0.244338268535413 In that case, Angler was dropping the trojan downloader Bedep-which in turn is being used for two main purposes: hijacking PCs for ad fraud (an infected PC becomes a zombie in a botnet that generates fake clicks on ads for pay-per-click revenue) and for downloading ransomware like CryptoLocker.
0.189983066486014 In these cases, it went further: the BEDEP backdoor was installed onto user systems (under the file name rifa.dll .).
0.1318560819065718 In turn it downloads Bedep malware, which is known for loading ad fraud payloads or dropping additional malicious code onto a victim's machine.
0.0835970953454733 It seems like there's quite a few Exploit kits floating around, which basically bundle together a whole set of exploits and pop a web browser however they can to install further malware, things like Bedep just slurp down even more malware and install that covertly on a victims machine.
0.0827049967731093 Notably, a malvertising campaign impacting popular adult website xHamster was also uncovered earlier this week, and was found to have also used the Angler EK to spread Bedep to vulnerable users.
0.260434466501457 On unprotected machines, the Angler Exploit Kit will install Bedep, a distribution botnet that can load multiple payloads on the infected host.
0.761924361272541 Saboteurs have continued to target vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player in order to spread malware, called " Bedep .".

0.698940969505849 The Bedep malware was programmed to create a hidden virtual desktop on a victim's computer and runs a fully-featured Internet Explorer instance, Kogan wrote.
0.417255350487479 The choice of the Bedep malware is not casual, bad actors exploited its ability to use a hidden virtual desktop on the infected computer and runs a fully-featured Internet Explorer instance, in this way the victims will never notice the visits to the propaganda videos and websites hosting advertisements.
0.793350329821462 The details of Bedep with click fraud has been covered thoroughly and will not be specifically discussed in this article.
0.346537899104109 The exploit frequently results in an install of the Bedep trojan which forces the victim computer to visit numerous sites in a bid to generate fake traffic to ads.
0.3063098763900242 The exploit kit is Angler and malware payload appears to be Bedep, similar to the Internet Software Consortium attack we reported on in December 2014.
0.595734904580494 The firm said that the similarities provide "no conclusive evidence linking the authors of Poweliks and Bedep together," only evidence that Bedep "also acts as a downloader and has a similar coding style to Poweliks.".
0.301531760760898 The first payload you get hit with is the infamous fileless malware also known as Bedep which enrolls you inside of a botnet:
0.532602913825827 "The first payload you get hit with is the infamous fileless malware also known as Bedep which enrolls you inside of a botnet," Jerome Segura, senior security researcher at Malwarebytes, wrote in a Wednesday blog post , citing a tweet by Kafeine.
0.0737451842977467 The new Angler exploit kit includes also the code to exploit two known vulnerabilities, but security industry way scared by the presence of a zero-day in Flash that was being used in the wild to install a the Bedep malware.
0.0435672988355063 The threat actors behind the malvertising campaign used the Angler exploit kit to infect victims with the Bedep trojan , recently used to hit also the adult web site xHamster.
0.799006432168893 This detail is rather interesting as this is not the first time an Adobe zero-day has used BEDEP malware as its final payload.
0.302434608791520 This new version of the Angler exploit kit includes also the code to exploit two known bugs, the researcher that he first discovered the exploit for the zero-day in Flash on Wednesday and that it is being used in the wild to install a the Bedep malware.
0.3198804044574886 While these attacks made BEDEP far more widespread, it was not exactly a new malware family either.
0.549565427184540 More recently, we worked with law enforcement in the United Kingdom to disrupt the Caphaw botnet, also known as Shylock, which targeted banks in Europe, Boscovich wrote in blog post.
0.427720252910808 a campaign misusing Skype to replicate and spread the Shylock banking Trojan with a plugin called that, when it was first spotted five days ago, was detected by none of the AV solutions used by VirusTotal.
0.4176599027528561 According to a map showing the distribution of Shylock infections that was published by CSIS, there's a high concentration of victims in the UK.
0.579199201725497 According to the NCA, which announced the takedown on 10 July, Shylock targeted the UK more than any other country, although the suspected developers are based elsewhere.
0.305698322481096 Authorities and private firms collaborate to combat Shylock malware.

0.0422292542901152 Cybercrime, including the likes of Shylock, helps contribute to a worldwide negative impact on employment while draining approximately $445 billion from that economy.
0.621920513539942 Europol announced today that it, along with international law enforcement and industry partners, conducted a successful takedown of the infrastructure supporting the Shylock banking malware.
0.357830057624727 First CSIS researchers unearthed a campaign misusing Skype to replicate and spread the Shylock banking Trojan, then Trend Micro researchers discovered highly dangerous worms also being propagated via Skype messages containing malicious links.
0.402221924500915 Furthermore, thus far, the people behind Shylock remain unidentified - other than a few speculative references to Russian appearing in the malware's code.
0.624781913723673 Global action brings positive results - an example being the operation targeting the Shylock malware.
0.1496863842645762 However, there are also many Shylock-infected computers throughout mainland Europe and the US..
0.756279606229487 In a series of sting operations, the team of international law enforcement and security experts seized the Command and Control servers (C&Cs) and the domains used by Shylock to communicate with infected computers.
0.1687287724406422 In addition to the souped up capabilities, Shylock is going global, spreading notably to Italy and the US.
0.581553974172086 In January 2013, Iurii Khvyl and Peter Kruse from CSIS posted analysis of Shylock variant capable of spreading through Skype.
0.399160916693144 In particular, when executed from a remote desktop session the return code will be different and Shylock won't install.
0.68214807686095 In that case, a federal court order replaced rogue DNS servers with legitimate ones, but unlike the Shylock operation, there were arrests and formal charges brought forward on those thought to be responsible.
0.0916522513463788 International law enforcement and security experts have disrupted the activities of the financial Trojan Shylock, according to the UK National Crime Agency (NCA).
0.177048339855057 It's important to note that this collaborative takedown effort caused damage to Shylock's infrastructure.
0.319104452354189 Kaspersky Lab products detect the Shylock malware as Backdoor.Win32.
0.68493069103119 Like most malware strains, Shylock continues to evolve in order to bypass new defensive technologies put in place by financial institutions and enterprises.
0.345121909622632 More advanced than other banking Trojans, Shylock has a targeted distribution network which allows the cyberattackers to infect victims through multiple channels, and the Trojan has been continuously updated in response to countermeasures set by targeted banks.
0.449087253337366 NCA has not released an estimate of how long they expect the Shylock operators to be out of commission.
0.301571186476671 Of course, these numbers don't tell us everything about how widespread or effective Shylock is, because Kaspersky Lab "sees" only a part of the total number of PC users - only those who use our products.
0.493707891597315 Of late, financial malware known as Shylock was discovered to have the ability to detect whether it was being executed on a computer over remote desktop protocol .
0.4557455637813835 Reports of Shylock malware found on certain Skype messages was a hot topic last week.
0.0448980329132043 "Shylock has always exhibited more advanced evasion tactics than the average malware.
0.4235713929945559 Shylock has infected at least 30,000 Windows computers globally, with the UK being targeted
0.688641431842250 Shylock is better than most banking malware, which typically siphons up a user's banking credentials and relays them to attackers for later use.
0.448747371581721 Shylock is considered a serious banking cyber threat especially in the future due its constant update and the introduction of new feature to increase spread capabilities and evade detection activities.
0.427303027603575 Shylock is probably owned and operated by one group of malicious actors based in Eastern Europe, and may be offered as a service to other criminal groups, according to Jason Milletary, technical director for malware analysis on the Dell SecureWorks' Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team that worked on this project.
0.774089282187483 Shylock malware joins the list of malicious programs enhancing their defenses to avoid analysis by researchers.
0.4255879421693129 Shylock was discovered in September 2011 and specializes in financial fraud.
0.2965957693258758 Shylock/Capshaw banking threat has hit banks across the EU
0.286846363145995 So it was no surprise that the UK's neonate National Crime Agency (NCA) spearheaded the international collaboration that, for the time being, has disabled the botnet that serves the Shylock.
0.3582864113052278 Symantec estimates that the cybercriminals behind Shylock have stolen million dollars from victims over the past three years, with over 60,000 infections were detected in the past year alone.
0.557734421013000 Symantec estimates that the gang behind Shylock has stolen several million dollars from victims over the past three years.
0.0634473716062772 Symantec's estimates for Shylock's geographical targeting is shown below.
0.760355430729834 Synonymous with a ruthless money lender, the name Shylock is the brainchild of William Shakespeare.
0.31094395755687 The end result, of course, is the installation of the Shylock malware - but achieved by tried and tested social engineering rather than the hit-and-miss exploit kit approach used with other malware.
0.3797175143550919 The fictitious Shylock's misfortune begins as, befitting his overzealous nature, the creditor attempts to collect a pound of human flesh promised to him when a borrower (and rival) defaults on a loan.
0.497937491423704 The groups "jointly addressed" the Shylock Trojan, seizing the Command and Control (C&C) servers -- which relay instructions to the malware -- in a series of stings, as well as taking control of the domains Shylock uses for communication between infected computers.
0.309190253824423 The latest strain of banking trojan Shylock invokes a new method to circumvent the prying eyes of security researchers.
0.680204881724190 The NCA, along with the FBI and agencies in six other countries, seized control of the Shylock command and control (C&C) servers and took over the domains used by Shylock for connections between infected computers.
0.710187396639985 This is a big enough scale to cause huge financial damage, so the disruption of the Shylock backbone infrastructure is very good news.
0.65760528571856 "This phase of activity is intended to have a significant effect on the Shylock infrastructure, and demonstrates how we are using partnerships across sectors and across national boundaries to cut cyber crime impacting the UK.".
0.0494036247119137 Victims of Shylock, which logs keystrokes and injects rogue phone numbers and chat forms into web pages, have primarily been customers of U.S. and European financial institutions.
0.3867705345804849 What separates Shylock from the pack are its evasion techniques, Klein said.
0.3993944119842889 When Shylock detects that it is running in a virtual environment, the program will exit, according to Trusteer.
0.1521133601838927 While Shylock and other malware attempt to prevent themselves from running in virtual machines, VMs have become such a common part of infrastructure that other malicious programs seek out such systems.
0.2633866681557488 With Shylock, however, cybercriminals have developed customized financial fraud capabilities for the malware, including an improved methodology for injecting code into additional browser processes to take control of the victim's computer, and an improved evasion technique to prevent malware scanners from detecting its presence.
0.1388582873517497 With such a complex and previously unseen method of divide, hide, and conquer, it's no wonder that Shylock received the attention of UK and worldwide law enforcement, especially given that it's just one player in the world of malware bought, sold, and deployed by the cyber-criminal underground.
0.32651531697573 Analysis of a malware sample matching the MD5 hash signature of the "Destover" malware that was used in the attack on Sony Pictures by researchers at Cisco revealed that the code was full of bugs, and anything but sophisticated.
0.2452316696781949 Destover wiper malware, also known as Wipall, has been compared to threats with similar capabilities, like Shamoon and Jokra.
0.346100398294109 In addition, Destover, the malware which has been linked to the attack, shares C&C infrastructure with other malicious code specifically crafted in the past to attack South Korea, according to Symantec .
0.1083567471798763 In an e-mail exchange with Ars, Kaspersky Lab security researcher Kurt Baumgartner said, "Of the three, the Shamoon and Destover implementations share the most similarities, and based on these similarities it is possible that there was shared guidance or expertise between the two projects.
0.0667437775286674 In the meantime, the FBI has issued a Flash warning about Destover, which is firmly aimed at sabotage: the Trojan has droppers that install and run EldoS RawDisk drivers to evade NTFS security permissions and overwrite disk data and the master boot record (MBR) itself.
0.2737213742560030 It is news of the day that experts at Kaspersky Lab have detected a new strain of Destover malware digitally signed with Sony certificates stolen in the cyber attacks, a technique that could allow the group to hit many other targets avoiding detection of not upgraded defense systems.
0.504181045100460 Keigher's account appears to square with Kaspersky Lab's teardown of the new version of Destover, which it says is functionally identical to a previous version of the malware that appears to have been compiled in July.
0.400960765176723 Like Shamoon, Destover uses commercially available EldoS RawDisk driver files both to evade NTFS security permissions and to override the master boot record (MBR) .
0.1021889457924803 Notably, however, a different version of Destover was used to attack Sony on Nov. 24, and was compiled just days before the attack and customized for Sony's infrastructure.

0.1550667701406790 Security experts have detected a new strain of the Destover malware that was used in the recent Sony Pictures Entertainment breaches characterized by a singular feature, the sample is signed by a legitimate certificate stolen from Sony .
0.679734060501844 Security firm Kaspersky Labs reports that a new sample of the Destover malware-the malware family used in the recent attack on the networks of Sony Pictures-has been found bearing a valid digital signature that could help it sneak past security screening on some Windows systems.
0.586882911833298 The group that claimed credit for the attack against the Sony Pictures, the GOP , has stolen a huge amount of data from the company, including corporate sensitive information, unreleased movies and evidently also digital certificates used to sign the Destover sample.
0.301064662658902 The new, signed version of Destover appears to have been compiled in July 2014 and was signed on last Dec. 5.
0.591295830093286 The Sony Pictures Entertainment attack that shut down its corporate network before Thanksgiving would appear to be much more broad-ranging than originally thought-and is believed to have been caused by a destructive wiper dubbed Destover.
0.254949885951346 "This certificate is already revoked," a spokeswoman for DigiCert told The Register on Tuesday, meaning Windows systems should reject the Destover build when its cryptographic signature is checked by the operating system.
0.114595888034219 While we still don't know the full extent of the damage at Sony, some security experts are already calling it a "game changer," in part because hackers used destructive "wiper" malware known as "Destover," or "Wipall," to infect and erase hard drives at Sony Pictures.
0.383598228495677 It is also called "FBI Moneypak" or the "FBI virus" as it often uses the FBI or local police logos and asks you to pay using Green Dot MoneyPak.

0.1629534657448191 Facebook has announced to have successfully conducted the takeover of the Lecpetex botnet in Greece.
0.499093099485643 "Fundamentally, the Lecpetex botnet is a collection of modules installed on a Windows computer that can steal a person's online credentials and use that access to spread through private messages," Facebook explained.
0.176292565173041 Lecpetex launched more than 20 different spam runs between December 2013 and June 2014 and relied mainly on luring potential victims via social engineering ploys to run Java applications and scripts that were rigged with malware and infected their machines.
0.69037814443257 Two of the alleged masterminds behind the botnet were arrested in Greece last week for their role in the so-called Lecpetex botnet.
0.6956269327893 We called this new malware ItaDuke because it reminded us of Duqu and because of the ancient Italian comments in the shellcode copied from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy.
0.522580424135898 2 ACAD/Medre.A The Story The malware news today is all about new targeted, high-tech, military grade malicious code such as Stuxnet, Duqu and Flamer that have grabbed headlines.
0.739559082920570 A cybercrime syndicate would also have to either produce its own ICS equipment or blackmail a vendor to properly utilize the information obtained from Duqu.
0.573708474053524 A few days ago, the security industry was surprised by the discovery of a new strain of the popular Duqu worm , so called Duqu 2.0 .
0.461668913859024 A few weeks ago, Iran reported intensified cyberattacks on its energy sector that they observed as a direct continuation of the Stuxnet and Duqu attacks.
0.55560270427644 A new piece of malware dubbed Gauss, that experts say is a direct descendant of Flame and also related to Stuxnet and Duqu, has been found on thousands of PCs in the Middle East, mostly in Lebanon.
0.432411556772981 A state-sponsored espionage group that uses a malware platform called Duqu has compromised the computer networks of several hotels and venues that hosted negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.
0.256392989611998 According to Symantec, there is a 50 percent similarity between Stuxnet's code and Duqu.
0.739026916060878 Accordingly, this technique of coding malware is also seen in threats like DUQU and Andromeda.
0.574931420306854 "After reviewing the technical analysis from Kaspersky, it's safe to say that Duqu 2.0 represents both the state of the art and the minimum bar for cyber-operations.
0.0966577999060416 Although some Stuxnet binaries and associated research data were released by Anonymous following its infiltration of HBGary , one cannot say hackers used this code to create Duqu.
0.1447064062074829 An analysis of software drivers used by both Stuxnet and the later Duqu malware has found that the both Stuxnet and Duqu are built on an identical platform, which Kaspersky has dubbed the "tilded" platform, for its use of the tilde (~) character in file names.
0.05551546179820010 An array of sophisticated malware with names including Stuxnet, Flame, and Duqu have been unleashed on networks in Iran and other Middle East countries, reportedly after the programs were supported and executed by the US and Israeli military officials .
0.51419877923105 An investigation led to the discovery of a new malware platform which it recognised as Duqu, described by the company as one of the most skilled, mysterious and powerful threat actors in the APT world.
0.3722367542982306 An open-source tool from the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security hunts for Duqu using telltale signs left behind by the Tilde-D creation toolkit.
0.513231399159158 Analysis of Wiper led Kaspersky researchers to discover Flame, which was related to Stuxnet and Duqu, which also targeted critical infrastructure in the Middle East.
0.636199558356660 And by the way, Stuxnet used the same extensions and this kind of similar mechanism to infect computers and install - basically, to install itself in computers," Costin Raiu, one of the researchers who did the initial analysis of Duqu at Kaspersky Lab, said in an interview after the malware's discovery.
0.3171470858962769 And let's not forget that kernel-based attacks are starting to go mainstream, given the fact that the Duqu exploit has been folded into the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits , even though most of these vulnerabilities, the Duqu vulnernability included, have been patched.
0.573318591145142 And the field of exploit writing and development has gotten a whole lot of PR recently with Stuxnet and Flame and Duqu and all that.
0.1792100579000348 And while it turns out that Duqu and Stuxnet probably were written by the same crew , they're not much alike at all.
0.417018112782605 Another intriguing -- and alarming -- tidbit: the Duqu gang doesn't use the same digital certificate twice, which could mean they have a stockpile of stolen digital legitimate certificates it can use in future attacks, Raiu says.
0.4678098350198063 Another piece of malware that famously spun out of control was Stuxnet , which not only escaped its original cage - i.e., targeting an Iranian nuclear facility - to bite a whole bunch of countries not originally on the hit list, but also spawned its nasty son, Duqu.
0.551456505066461 Based on these factors, it can be stated with a high level of confidence that the authors of Stuxnet and Duqu are the same.
0.316039678239259 Because of the way Duqu 2.0 survives in memory, Kaspersky advises all network computers be rebooted at the same time, as if simulating a power failure, or else the malware can persist and re-infect other machines.
0.477271189764583 Bencsath, whose team discovered the very first variant of Duqu, says Kaspersky Lab was "brave" to give details of the attack on its own infrastructure.
0.517649950784964 Both BEAST and Duqu are pretty nasty malware , I'd guess seen as though they've already fixed the BEAST problem - they just need to work on compatibility issues - that we'll definitely be seeing the patch rolled out in the January Patch Tuesday .
0.3912436611052184 "Both Duqu and Stuxnet are highly complex programs with multiple components," they wrote .
0.3154855108220263 </b></p><p><p>Flame is a sophisticated attack toolkit, which is a lot more complex than Duqu.
0.3332340526044522 But given the stealthy way Duqu 2.0 operates in memory and disappears altogether when a system is rebooted -- the attackers can do this themselves to cover their tracks -- how can anyone be sure they aren't a victim?
0.485067503133793 But Gostev says Flame's architecture is different from the framework behind Stuxnet and Duqu.
0.393258583662745 But that attention apparently hasn't persuaded the group that it's time to tone down their pursuits, as evidenced by the fact that researchers have discovered a newly compiled driver for Duqu within the last couple of days.
0.0643502272307532 But the newer malware is much more highly evolved than the first Duqu samples, researchers said, and it is more advanced than some of the techniques used by the infamous Equation Group revealed earlier this year.
0.55395635144466 Company officials were unable to provide Ars with an estimate of how many megabytes or gigabytes of data were extracted from their network, in part because the custom network connections Duqu used may have bypassed normal logging procedures.
0.352783914770356 Compared to Stuxnet and Duqu, it's likely this malware framework was authored and developed in parallel, with a broader goal: comprehensive intelligence gathering.
0.533274764458744 Cybercrime syndicates are not sophisticated enough or willing to pull off a multiyear operation, like Stuxnet or Duqu.
0.619769051107294 Defining this kind of attack tool is difficult, but if you think of attacks involving tools such as Duqu , Flame and Gauss , you're in the right ballpark.

0.251931662399630 Duqu 2.0 attack on Kaspersky Lab opens chilling New chapter In cyber espionage.
0.756034313457161 Duqu 2.0 infections at several hotels that hosted negotiations between Iran and the U.S., Germany, France, Russia, the U.K. and China
0.274402787302862 Duqu 2.0 is a very sophisticated agent that exploited a number of zero-days vulnerabilities and malware researchers noticed that among its targets there were entities linked to the negotiations about Iran's nuclear deal and IT security firms.
0.368134100150251 Duqu 2.0 resides in memory making hard its detection and use a complex system to communicate with the control infrastructure.
0.2303122693331551 Duqu 2.0, the malware that infected systems at Kaspersky could have been designed by Israel, no doubts abou the state-sponsored attack.
0.51463234038932 Duqu and Flame both developed to gather sensible information from Iranian Government
0.600101647473766 Duqu and Stuxnet may be used in future attacks, but it is likely the attackers will use Duqu as an additional learning exercise to avoid detection in the future when using whatever major malcode follows Duqu.
0.60214964905971 Duqu attackers have a major interest in hardware manufacturers such as Foxconn, Realtek and Jmicron
0.4800843922999652 Duqu first came to light in September and was immediately dubbed a successor to the Stuxnet worm, which is credited with disabling uranium enrichment facilities within Iran.
0.795436896266404 Duqu got a bum rap initially, because it was dubbed the son of Stuxnet and Stuxnet Jr. and whatever else headline writers could come up with to attach it to that infamous worm.
0.671538539472763 Duqu is a highly sophisticated malware platform used for cyberespionage that was originally found in 2011.
0.3242484516336874 Duqu is a remote access Trojan designed to steal information from specific organizations and uses many of the same techniques as other malware.
0.558744707642859 Duqu is used for information gathering with its functions of screen capturing, network information capture, keylogger, viewable shares, file explorer, and domain enumeration.
0.304475671703934 Duqu looked to be designed for espionage, particularly information related to industrial systems - potentially information that could fuel future attacks similar to those of Stuxnet.
0.317823773106712 Duqu malware makes a comeback and infiltrates Kaspersky systems.
0.455830301313872 Duqu, Stuxnet, Flame and Gauss have all been compiled with versions of Microsoft Visual C, while Narilam was built with Borland C++ Builder 6 (and not Delphi, as other articles seem to suggest), a completely different programming tool.".
0.4247103091936220 Duqu's precise relation to Stuxnet remained a mystery when the group behind it went dark in 2012.
0.151703619048070 During the past year, few security events gained as much media attention as the Duqu malware outbreak.
0.3122683823673465 Enterprises with high security environments and highly valuable assets should be more concerned, since they might be targets for Duqu-like attacks.
0.15486751437681 "Even if one doubts that Stuxnet, Duqu, and Duqu 2.0 are sourced from well-financed, highly skilled, and geopolitically motivated Western nations, Duqu 2.0 is precisely where we should expect any serious national cyber offensive capability to be.".
0.1719294314049736 Even if one doubts that Stuxnet, Duqu, and Duqu 2.0 are sourced from well-financed, highly skilled, and geopolitically motivated Western nations, Duqu 2.0 is precisely where we should expect any serious national cyber-offensive capability to be," said Tod Beardsley, engineering manager at Rapid7.
0.612010022361926 Even so, Duqu 2.0 has a remote process for reinfecting a machine if necessary after it's rebooted.
0.55877700681072 example is Flame, a threat that affected the Iranian Oil Ministry, which also had its predecessors Duqu Given these differences, we find more complex Social and Stuxnet, both malicious programs which, by Engineering campaigns that are not limited to the exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities, managed to access use of exploits and malicious codes, either generic or nuclear programs in the Middle East and cause sig- acquired on the black market.
0.331784869471707 Exploits may be delivered via spearphish, as in the Duqu incident, or via a web page for a browser like Internet Explorer, as in Duqu copycat malcode like the Blackhole exploit pack that continues to be widely distributed and highly active.
0.727492563266066 First identified Oct. 14, researchers have said it is strikingly similar to the dangerous Stuxnet Trojan, though Duqu was designed specifically to gather intelligence data, not take down nuclear reactors like...
0.234328023020344 Fixing the underlying flaw exploited by Duqu involves the resolution of a problem in how Windows kernel mode driver handles TrueType font files.
0.510632407059045 "Flame is nothing really new, it doesn't bring any new qualities," he told Ars on Wednesday. "Cyber-espionage has been conducted for years. Duqu, the German [state trojan] do similar things-they can turn on the microphone for voice messages. It's not new. Espionage attacks are occurring worldwide on a daily basis and for purposes of state espionage. In my opinion, Flame might be a little bit overhyped."
0.712576938631493 Flame shares some similarities with Duqu, another piece of highly sophisticated espionage software that researchers suspect was also spawned with the resources of one or more governments.
0.771387445527198 Following this finding the company launched an intensive investigation, which led to the discovery of a new malware platform from one of the most skilled threat actors in the APT world: Duqu.
0.266741936577270 Font-parsing vulnerabilities have also been part of high-profile APT-style targeted attacks, including Duqu.
0.4719336418225680 For example, each variant of Duqu could have used different injection methods which may never be fully identified.
0.2773008368711795 For example, in 2011 the Duqu group infected a certificate authority in Hungary with the first version of the malware tool.
0.0515045351286963 For instance, Flame never uses system drivers, while Stuxnet and Duqu&#8217;s main method of loading modules for execution is via a kernel driver.
0.1147303864023415 For others, Stuxnet and Duqu were simply two more pieces of malware, albeit ones that happened to show up inside some interesting networks.
0.1249946607522860 "Gauss," as Kaspersky Lab researchers have dubbed the malware, was devised by the same "factory" or "factories" responsible for the Stuxnet worm used to disrupt Iran's nuclear program , as well as the Flame and Duqu Trojans.
0.585574626304492 Gauss is the latest of the four CW's being analyzed, with Flame and DUQU preceding Gauss.
0.483334415508823 Going all the way back to the Duqu attacks, font-parsing vulnerabilities and exploits have been symptomatic of some high-end espionage attacks targeting the Windows kernel .
0.512157953582866 He says his team has found no evidence of Duqu 2.0 infections at its site, and posted a blog on the new variant today.
0.636893060832712 Hence, the best bet for an enterprise to protect itself against damage or losses resulting from Duqu-like attacks is speedy detection and an incident response strategy.
0.1836086175261022 Here's some background to help to understand why: In December of 2011 Microsoft issued bulletin , which patched a vulnerability in the TrueType Font handling in win32k.sys DLL that had actively been exploited by the Duqu malware.
0.610594381532925 However, researchers are being quite careful to differentiate Flame from its predecessors, both in scope and construction, and say that the newer tool is likely unrelated to either Stuxnet or Duqu .
0.0401765095929870 However, there are most likely many variants of Duqu that have yet to be identified, including those that could have compile times before Stuxnet's release.
0.3528716703103973 If additional droppers are found that impacted other victims of Duqu, we could find out that they exploit different flaws.
0.2460379755771897 I'm hopeful that as this story unfolds, Kaspersky will provide more details on exactly how they did detect the activity of Duqu 2.0, since these detection techniques are what CISOs at critical infrastructure networks need to defend and remediate against similar attacks.".
0.719448498557190 Industrial Control System (ICS)/SCADA systems have been the talk of the security community for the last three or more years due to Stuxnet, Duqu, and other similar noteworthy attacks.
0.3212150602722405 Inside the Kaspersky network, Duqu sent data in the form of Windows file sharing traffic.
0.539108107280920 Instead, Duqu does not self-replicate after being injected onto a target system and only has a 36-day operation window before it deletes itself.
0.757908762471264 "It almost feels that the APT threat group used [Kaspersky Lab] as a pivot point for the Duqu 2.0 attack by breaching their internal defenses and driving a point home," he says.
0.1873986666965374 It is likely that there are multiple droppers for Duqu that may include multiple types of 0-days.
0.0463232526287845 It now turns out that the Duqu creators were actually working on an even more sophisticated version of the malware platform that runs only in the compromised system's memory and doesn't modify disk files or system settings-Duqu 2.0.
0.501032319914533 It suggests espionage malware such as Flame, Duqu, or a still-unknown title had burrowed into Iranian systems in the months or years prior to the beginning of the development work.
0.4367680506061629 It was Duqu, a sophisticated piece of malware dubbed the 'steal everything' virus for its ability to strip a computer system clean.
0.06183577970833542 Its claim is that a part of Duqu was written with a programming language not seen before -- or, as Kaspersky says, that it at least can't identify.
0.2435050667465874 Its successors Duqu , Flame and Gauss also shared some of its code/design sophistication but neither were reported to have an impact on physical equipment, like Stuxnet did.
0.1976741939385017 Just this week another piece of the puzzle came together when researchers found that an odd programming language used in one part of Duqu was heavily modified C combined with some object-oriented programming components.
0.529398435399512 Kaspersky Lab believes that the Duqu 2.0 group first targeted an employee working in one of the company's offices in the Asia and Pacific region, likely through a spear-phishing email.
0.2383552631674458 Kaspersky Lab discovered in early spring that several of its internal systems had been compromised and the subsequent investigation resulted in the identification of what the company now calls Duqu 2.0.
0.799748861273081 Kaspersky Lab hasn't seen any ties to the so-called Equation Group -- thought by many in the industry to be the US National Security Agency -- and Duqu 2.0, although there were indications of some ties with Stuxnet.
0.49805211112586 Kaspersky Lab researchers helped in the initial investigation into Gauss and made the connection between Gauss and its predecessors Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame.
0.4338849590373592 Kaspersky Lab, which published a report on Duqu 2.0 last week, wrote in a blog post Monday that a 64-bit driver within the malware employed a digital certificate signed by Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn.
0.518415994690917 Kaspersky Lab's public request for help on an unsolved mystery surrounding Duqu serves as a case study in how to do technology evangelism.
0.4265088092848625 Kaspersky Labs reported not only that Duqu 2.0 has been found in the wild, but that the malware infected several Kaspersky Labs internal systems in early spring of 2015.
0.1775706045114476 Kaspersky said the new version of Duqu was created by the same group responsible for the original Duqu malware.
0.729491560136768 Kaspersky's director of global research & analysis, Costin Raiu, discovered with his team the existence of a common platform to build the malwares Duqu and Stuxnet, that they named "Tilded platform" because many of the files in agents have names beginning with the tilde symbol "~" and the letter "d."".
0.570514256182939 Kaspersky's investigation into the incident showed that the Duqu attackers had access to a small number of systems and were especially interested in the company's research into APT groups, its anti-APT technology, and some Kaspersky products, including the Secure Operating System and Kaspersky Security Network.
0.576256232502381 Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS), a Budapest, Hungary-based facility that originally discovered Duqu
0.259907475362900 Like Duqu, Gauss is highly modular, and it shares a "fair deal of code" with Flame.
0.4223711033907129 Many analysts still have some doubts as to the relationship between Duqu and Stuxnet, but this piece of the chain of infection was missing.
0.1037969503055650 Microsoft on Thursday confirmed the Windows kernel flaw used to spread Duqu , the so-called "son of Stuxnet " trojan, and issued a temporary fix to block attacks attempting to exploit the flaw.
0.506881362056578 Most reports on Duqu indicate it infiltrated networks many months prior to detection.
0.543738837552970 MS12-034 now provides the patches necessary to address these "Sons of Duqu," together with a number of other security fixes (9 CVEs) that were bundled into the same files.
0.1098908074740232 MS14-058 patches yet another kernel level font handling flaw CVE-2014-4148, the same kind of issue seen in the Duqu spearphish exploits.
0.3824704307095836 Next came Duqu , a similar tool with a broader target base that researchers said was closely related to Stuxnet and likely produced by the same team.
0.458794476838294 No one is standing up to take credit for attacks such as Stuxnet or Duqu, which leads to rampant speculation.
0.1962449231380822 Now security firm Symantec has done its own analysis of Duqu 2.0, which unlike the first version, lives only in the memory of infected computers, without writing any files on disk.
0.0984194044307015 One of those organizations was Symantec, whose own research team studied how the zero-day exploit eventually leads to the installation of Duqu.
0.0541290787451433 One other bit of weirdness involved in this episode is that there's another date that's hard-coded into the Duqu code.
0.1703860603075293 </p> <p>We believe Duqu and Stuxnet were simultaneous projects supported by the same team of developers.
0.3218603575980515 <P>2012 SOURCE Boston kicked off the first of three days with an opening talk on hacktivism and the Anonymous movement, Costin Raiu and Vitaly Kamluk presented the latest in Duqu C2 research, and Vercode's Shyama Rose talked about designing and building out strategic programs for complex organizations.
0.671215037497292 <p>Duqu and Stuxnet raised the stakes in the cyber battles being fought in the Middle East - but now we&#8217;ve found what might be the most sophisticated cyber weapon yet unleashed.
0.2023474469369479 Previously, other cyberthreats such as Stuxnet and Duqu required months of analysis; this threat is clearly a magnitude more complex.
0.709200142577724 Rather than writing one piece of malware and spreading it out to a large potential victim base, the crew behind Duqu had a small, specially selected group of targets, each of which got its own specifically crafted components and drivers.
0.425958959915273 Relying mostly on similarities in the software code and the command and control servers used to send instructions and receive data, Kaspersky researchers also linked Gauss to the Stuxnet worm used to disrupt Iran's nuclear program and another espionage trojan known as Duqu .
0.1060035002188904 Researchers also found the chkconfig tool present, a Debian version of a popular Red Hat tool RedHatCentOS found in Duqu.
0.799737291153278 Researchers around the world put their heads together and solved the identity of 'mystery code' in the Duqu Trojan horse program, researchers from Kaspersky Lab announced on Monday.
0.05695973942441312 Researchers believe that the Duqu 2.0 attacks are the work of a nation-state and say that the ties between the new malware and the older Duqu platform are strong.
0.693443356988885 Researchers spent time observing live Duqu attackers as they manually traversed various company machines in search of research, intellectual property, and other proprietary information.
0.1384232852433412 Security experts sustain that Duqu was the product of a joint effort of the NSA Tao and the Israeli Unit 8200, it's obvious that both intelligence agencies are suspected also for Duqu 2.0.
0.744875937173680 Security researchers from different companies tracked Duqu developments for several months after its initial discovery in 2011, but the operation went dark in 2012.
0.532503802861756 Service disruptions such as the banking DDoS attacks coupled with nation-state espionage campaigns such as Flame , Red October and Duqu could force the shift Coviello is talking about.
0.3202753094318522 Shouwenberg presented some interesting findings, although none of it was particularly telling of what Duqu is designed to steal or where it may have come from.
0.635340623365978 "Since the connection between Flame and Stuxnet/Duqu has already been revealed , it can be concluded that all these advanced threats come from the same cyber-warfare factory," Gostev said.."miniFlame is a high precision attack tool," said Gostev. "Most likely it is a targeted cyber-weapon used in what can be defined as the second wave of a cyberattack."
0.24826268455460 Some researchers have theorized that Flame and Duqu may have provided the reconnaissance needed for operations such as Stuxnet.
0.659631197097125 Still outstanding is a zero-day Windows kernel flaw, which Microsoft confirmed last week to be connected to Duqu , the so-called "son of Stuxnet " trojan.
0.4484456667322861 Stuxnet and Duqu belonged to a single chain of attacks, which raised cyberwar-related concerns worldwide.
0.681948703198162 Stuxnet and the related Duqu virus discovered earlier this year share a similar architecture and may have been developed by the same team of developers--along with other pieces of malware--several years ago, according to a security researcher at Kapersky Lab.
0.1183289437755874 Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame are examples, allegedly orchestrated by the United States and Israel.
0.04564000121972955 Symantec scanned its own global network and found Duqu 2.0 infections in the U.S., U.K., Sweden, India and Hong Kong, as well as on the systems of a European network operator, a North African network operator and an electronic equipment manufacturer from South East Asia.
0.651116423268103 Symantec, which released a report on Duqu earlier this week, has said the Trojan was created to steal information from industrial control system (ICS) vendors.
0.772945203501103 "T here are a number of different drivers and different modules which are responsible for extracting the Duqu components to disk.
0.527551645307933 Targeted attacks are being helped along by the "children of STUXNET": attack code and kits like Flame, Duqu and Gauss that are derived from the STUXNET attack three years ago.
0.629480463949746 Technical analysis carried out by the security firm has indicated a new round of attacks from an updated version of the 2011 Duqu malware, which it called Duqu 2.0.
0.67331729857330 Telecoms, electronics and the information security sectors are being warned of potential threat from a new version of the Duqu worm, the existence of which has been confirmed by Kaspersky Lab.
0.789728291360049 That's the very same strategy employed in the first-generation of Duqu thought to be a precursor to the Stuxnet attack.
0.58460793059010 The analysis moves the world's understanding of Duqu forward and, in part, dispels earlier analyses that linked the malware to the Stuxnet worm .
0.0516492855590460 The analysis published by Kaspersky revealed that Duqu 2.0 was not designed by the Equation Group , this means that Israel is the prime suspect for the campaign.
0.52133305558835 The attackers behind the Duqu 2.0 malware that targeted Kaspersky Lab may have used stolen digital certificates from legitimate hardware manufacturers to sign the malware.
0.596365731864503 The attacks that took place in 2014 and this year involved the use of a new version of the Duqu cyberespionage malware, according to antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab, which also found the malware on its own systems.
0.442636935611271 The company is renowned for its leading expertise, which provides unparalleled depth of analysis and understanding of all kinds of threats, from common malware to targeted attacks and the most sophisticated cyber weapons like Flame, Duqu, Red October, NetTraveler etc.
0.187463383089384 The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit team has written a great question and answer threat analysis on the Duqu Trojan.
0.50134703385491 The discovery of miniFlame also gives us additional evidence of the cooperation between the creators of the most notable malicious programs used for cyber warfare operations: Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame and Gauss."
0.333339117968023 The discovery of Red October opens yet another chapter in the just-begun era of highly advanced espionage malware that already included Duqu, Flame, and Gauss.
0.1682990205912506 The Duqu 2.0 attackers exploited at least one confirmed zero-day vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft on Tuesday, and possibly two other vulnerabilities that are now patched, but had zero-day status when the group was using them, the Kaspersky researchers said in a report released Wednesday.
0.747721481187431 The Duqu attackers, who haven't been seen in action by Kaspersky since March 2012 , began this latest attack campaign sometime in the fall of 2013.
0.40471654298616 * The Duqu malware is being touted as "Son of Stuxnet" , despite having more differences than similarities .
0.1793122276052523 The Duqu Trojan, or W32.Duqu, as it is formally known (pronounced dyü-kyü), creates files with the file name prefix "~DQ".
0.0879544727886463 "The fact that this Duqu 2.0 cyberattack was an in-memory attack [and] didn't create or modify any disk files or system settings, it made detection almost impossible for" Kaspersky, he says.
0.450176995283785 "The installer file is a Microsoft Word document that exploits a previously unknown kernel vulnerability that allows code execution," Symantec researcher Vikram Thakur wrote Tuesday in a blog post . "When the file is opened, malicious code executes and installs the main Duqu binaries."
0.795474002303752 The key difference with the Duqu 2.0 attacks is that the malware platform that team uses has modules that reside almost entirely in memory.
0.595234757205369 The last of the zero days used by the Duqu 2.0 attackers was patched by Microsoft on Tuesday.
0.630869168092635 The malware in the newer attacks appears to be an updated version of the original Duqu platform, and there are some similarities in the command and control infrastructure, as well.
0.559644297187308 The modular nature of the program, similar to other espionage threats such as Flame and Duqu, allowing attackers to pick and choose the final functionality of any particular attack, as well as tailor the eventual malware to the target`s environment.
0.2145319493255252 The most disconcerting fact related to the discovery of the malware is that Duqu 2.0 was used to hack systems at Kaspersky Lab.
0.723350516589282 The perfect crime: Is Wiper malware connected to Stuxnet, Duqu?
0.4143936097884438 The progenitor of Duqu , Flame and Gauss are reported as the authors of STUXNET .
0.3492636179552792 The reliable supply of compromised certificates is yet another testament to the confidence and competency of the Duqu attackers.
0.352049813685909 The researchers at CrySyS Lab in Hungary, who first discovered Duqu, agreed that Flame, which they call sKyWIper, is the work of a well-funded government.
0.616599916411404 The researchers believe that Flame was not developed by the authors of Stuxnet and Duqu, and that it might have been released before or simultaneously with them.
0.692345113867174 The researchers pointed out these attackers' predilection for using stolen software digital certs to sign their malware - they did it before by using certs issued to hardware manufacturers Jmicron and Realtek for signing components of Stuxnet and earlier versions of Duqu.
0.649259892555062 The second one addresses cyber espionage and exploitation, especially the various aspects of Chinese cyber strategy, the various spying tools / malware such as Duqu and Flame that is considered to have been developed by hackers working for a nation-state, espionage via social networking, and information theft during real-world conflicts.
0.761378716516572 The stolen certificate strategy demonstrates a trend in how the Duqu attackers try to operate under the radar in their targets' networks, he notes.
0.254293408025866 The toolkit, which is thought to have spawned past espionage tools such as Stuxnet and Duqu, can spread through local networks or on removable drives such as USB sticks.
0.1928974084554725 The unknown potency of these cyber weapons in comparison to Stuxnet and Duqu can create a level of deterrence that is unattainable with conventional weapons.
0.528563273809798 The year's first variant of the notorius W32.Duqu, a trojan that seems intended for cyber war, has been discovered by Symantec researchers.
0.636170937319804 The zero-day exploit was confirmed by the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS), a Budapest, Hungary-based facility that originally discovered Duqu.
0.3816076333881387 There have been assessments made that Duqu and Stuxnet may not be related because some of the functions and techniques, including kernel driver injection points, are used in other unrelated malware.
0.527981526884553 "There is no other way for Duqu to misuse these digital certificates for 64-bit Windows driver loading than to steal them.".
0.2907831508360946 This chapter also include a great four-page summary of the intricacies of the Flame, Stuxnet and Duqu malware and how it was used.
0.372843797595291 This discovery is just the last in order of time, in the last couple of years several cyber espionage campaigns have been discovered, from Duqu to Flame , arriving to recent Mahdi and Red October , the complexity of the operations, the target chosen, the nature of information stolen and the capability of attacker to maintains low profile for a so long time led security expert to believe that behind the campaigns there are groups of state sponsored hackers that conduct intelligence for their governmets.
0.1128640737190803 "This is going to give the patch management folks some serious heartburn," he said in an email of the new patch. "Evidently, Microsoft discovered that the same bits of bad code that were fixed in MS11-087 last year were copied and pasted into other applications, so they needed to fix those, too. Since other changes were pending for those applications, all kinds of other bug fixes not related to Duqu [also] are bundled into this bulletin."
0.0461915962474289 This tip examines Duqu, its capabilities, and how enterprises should respond to a potential threat like the Duqu Trojan .
0.593202109848215 Though Duqu was not written to compromise industrial control systems, as Stuxnet was, it is widely believed to be a sophisitcated piece of malware targeted at a small population of potential victims .
0.4648532349442584 Threat actors used a Duqu 2.0 worm in a series of attacks worldwide that also breached the systems at Kaspersky Lab.
0.42901064216049 Threatpost: We've seen in the last year Stuxnet variants like Duqu ¸ and other malware that seems to use aspects of the Stuxnet code.
0.453330940798307 Three of the 10 vulnerabilities are publicly known, and the most severe of the holes involve the improper handling of TrueType font files, which was the vector by which Duqu is believed to have spread.
0.412181850672704 To summarize, the threat shows great similarity to Stuxnet and Duqu in some of its ways of operation, yet its code base and implementation are very different, and much more complex and robust in its basic structure.
0.144143738732699 TrueType font parsing, the software functionality attacked in targeted attacks including the Duqu campaign and currently a part of the Blackhole exploit kit, again enables exploitation of another vulnerability in kernel mode graphics handling component GDI+.
0.574285817449049 Using Duqu as an example for a CSIRT exercise also prepares an organization for a similar targeted attack.
0.0999213083597549 Vikram Thakur, senior manager of Symantec Security Response, says the Duqu 2.0 attack on Kaspersky Lab represents a new type of attack by nation-state actors.
0.418366967253451 We also saw what we've dubbed the "children" of Stuxnet-Flame, Flamer, Gauss, and Duqu-due to similarities such as in code.
0.047249155667735 We do not know if the people behind Duqu switched to Gauss at that time but we are quite sure they are related: Gauss is related to Flame, Flame is related to Stuxnet, Stuxnet is related to Duqu.
0.431776133285513 We have already witnessed organized and sophisticated attacks such as Stuxnet, Duqu, and similar assaults.
0.796373078603900 We saw this tactic pick up momentum with the rise of attacks like Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame (to name a few).
0.0626485739812199 Well, Cylance firm suspects it is revenge from the US and Israel for developing the Stuxnet worm that infected Iran's nuclear program years ago, and launching espionage campaigns using Flame and Duqu malware .
0.1125591162230649 What sets Duqu 2.0 apart from its predecessor and other attacks is how it hides out: the code runs in the victim computer's memory only, and deletes its tracks on the hard drive.
0.563297810790028 While Flame, Duqu, and Stuxnet were garnering media coverage, we set out to find samples to see what they were really targeting and via what method.
0.584161157735617 While many security pros have called Duqu the 'Son of Stuxnet,' the only known linkage is the shared code, Bejtlich said.
0.255060166790811 While much is still not known about who created Duqu - for example: its exact purpose or country of origin - Kaspersky Lab researchers say that those behind it were running a "highly sophisticated" operation, typical of what is found in "complex 'civil' software projects, rather than contemporary malware.".
0.429876562590793 While some instances of Stuxnet and Duqu found their way into seemingly unplanned locations, the majority of occurrences were localized to targeted systems.
0.731562162070325 While SOO is one of a few different such frameworks, the output of those other frameworks doesn't match the Duqu code nearly as closely as SOO, according to a post by Igor Soumenkov on Kaspersky's Securelist blo g. Kamluk said the use of OOC rather than the more common C++ language suggested that the developers who wrote Duqu were likely older developers who came of age writing programs in C. ""It's what they were familiar with," he said.
0.1709868499190386 While the two families were superficially similar and both complex, subsequent analysis of the Duqu code makes it clear that Stuxnet and Duqu were more different than alike.
0.467638991167560 "While the two groups, Duqu and Equation, might have cooperated in the past, it seems they are now separate - for instance, one victim of Duqu 2.0 was infected by both the Equation Group and Duqu at the same time, indicating the two entities are different and competing for information from their victims," Kaspersky's Baumgartner says.
0.2997614164031937 Wiper, as the earlier wiping program is known, shared a file-naming convention almost identical to those used by the state-sponsored Stuxnet and Duqu operations, an indication it may have been related , security researchers said.
0.692083340687565 With all the similarities between Stuxnet and Duqu, the interesting part lies with the order of their release.
0.374685144782906 With Duqu 2.0, the encryption algorithms used vary from case to case, making it more difficult to establish relationships between infections.
0.263611870363256 Without an industry-wide effort to stem the inherent vulnerabilities in OPC, Havex could prove itself to be another devastating "industrial" RAT-alongside DisktTrack (a.k.a. Shamoon), Duqu, Stuxnet, and Gauss-capable of remote command of control systems.
0.743056755001061 Writing on the Securelist blog , Kaspersky Labs researcher Alex Gostev traced the development of two key drivers and variants that are used in both Stuxnet and Duqu, as well as two previously unknown drivers that were almost identical to the Stuxnet/Duqu drivers.
0.3538910699768834 You've also heard of APT campaigns such as Stuxnet and Duqu that used signed executables and trusted certificates.
0.260320368490482 The McAfee Security Blog says that when Koobface infects your system it initiates a downloaded service named Security Accounts Manager SamSs to load on start up.
0.369184255442438 A new version of the infamous Koobface worm designed to attack Mac OS X computers is spreading through Facebook and other social networking sites, security experts warn.
0.3060789438343124 An operation as big as Koobface needs the expertise of other researchers, investigators and involved parties for mitigation.
0.3736345360540350 And we are proud to say that our technical analysis and due diligence in monitoring Koobface activities made us understand the botnet intimately, and enabled us to respond and apply the appropriate solution to protect our customers.
0.4936297599986888 At its peak, Koobface was popularly known as the malware propagating through the (then) steeply rising social network Facebook, but of course, it was more than that.
0.648638984617846 Attackers make large use of social engineering methods to attract users, proposing the download of cool video or applications that hide installer for the Koobface virus.
0.2560950867599103 Back in 2008-2009, Facebook was just becoming the dominant social network that it is now, and was just starting to distance itself from the likes of Myspace, Twitter, Friendster, myyearbook, etc. Our first research paper about Koobface provided detailed overview that Koobface was not only exclusively propagating on Facebook, and that it also utilized the other social networks popular during that time.
0.4609580552238793 Chet Wisniewski, a frequent guest on the MarketPlace Tech Report radio show, has been discussing social networking threats - including the infamous Koobface worm.
0.509700336961723 Command and control (C&C) servers used by owners of the Koobface botnet have reportedly stopped responding following an investigation this week.
0.603302395232648 Cybercrime investigators at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have been awarded $250,000 by Facebook, for the great work they do helping fight cybercrime - including helping unmask the people behind the Koobface botnet.
0.609677718945028 -Don't "Friend" people you don't know - since 2008 criminals have been using Koobface (an anagram of facebook) code to infiltrate and infect facebook users by getting "friended" and passing on infected links.

0.692179443098022 During all these years, we are proud to say we here at Trend Micro has shown the effort and diligence to keep Koobface on our radar.
0.742789233504922 For example, Dancho Danchev has reported on "How the Koobface gang monetarizes Mac OS X" by compromising legitimate sites with a PHP backdoor shell in an attempt to direct OS X traffic to affiliate dating programmes.
0.553449095159577 For example, it is not rare to see more than 10,000 Koobface variants in a single month.
0.672549172520762 For instance, plenty of evidence about the identity of the Koobface malware gang was fortuitously found being carelessly shared by the cybercriminals on their VKontakte profile pages.
0.331955371284776 In light of these developments, Trend Micro will continuously observe the Koobface family of threats in order to keep our customers protected.
0.460742912524686 In the early part of this year, TrendLabs experts noted that the KOOBFACE gang was continuously updating their botnet-changing the botnet's architecture, introducing new component binaries, and merging the botnet's functions with other binaries.

0.1838667224982827 (Koobface is a notorious family of malware that primarily spreads via social networks, such as Facebook.
0.2362237252706265 Koobface malware, since its first appearance in 2008, has continued to arise intermittently with multiple variants that speed through the popular social networking site.
0.554920750129742 Koobface mostly uses compromised legitimate web servers as the front end CnCs keeping minimal dedicated servers as a backup, located in countries like China and Russia.
0.793242415651831 Koobface sends false messages and comments to the victim's friends, redirects them to a malicious website, and tries to steal log-in credentials to spread itself.
0.2772557986488730 Koobface virus is undoubtedly considered as the malware of social network because it was one of the first to use them as vehicle of infection.
0.1476281215672334 Koobface was popularly known as the malware propagating through the (then) steeply rising social network Facebook

0.62848534693719 Like many previous KOOBFACE variants, this is used to download malware onto the user's system.
0.734827995198646 McAfee said it initially declared a resurgence because what it believed were unique samples of Koobface actually turned out to be instances where part of the worm's underlying code was packaged as part of other binary files and malware, said McAfee researcher Craig Schmugar in a blog post.
0.166568535960123 Meanwhile, the KOOBFACE botnet has become the largest social networking threat to date.
0.46811931952261 Members of the Koobface malware gang might be feeling a little hot under the collar as evidence has begun to spill onto the internet about the alleged identity of one of its members.
0.350940753087611 Moreover, there have also been "partial" successes against the servers of other important botnets, such as Koobface in November of 2010[12].
0.3017912188220187 Nobody gives that much time and effort for nothing, so the question that remained was - what's in it for the Koobface gang?
0.520545065808987 "Our botnet monitoring and research activities discovered a URL path on a well-known Koobface command and control server from which we were able to download archived copies of Koobface's command and control infrastructure.

0.4131984675272738 Security officials at Facebook have been tracking the activities of the Koobface gang, as the social networking site has been the main infection vector for the malware.
0.568297003390701 Seeing the nickname "Ded" as one of the members of the gang, I can't help but recall "Ded Pixto" the nickname for Stanislav Avdeiko the Koobface malware author.
0.674200213247504 Several reports this week have named the alleged operators of the Koobface botnet as a small group of Russian men living in and around St. Petersburg.
0.632327493579408 Several weeks ago Koobface added DNS hijacking functionality that blocks access to security sites, tipping users off to the fact that something might be wrong with their systems.
0.563447254081281 Similar to previously featured KOOBFACE-related attacks, users were asked to install a rouge software to play the said video, an Adobe Flash Player file, which in reality, is a worm detected by Trend Micro as WORM_KOOBFACE.IT.
0.665581569985131 Targeted Attacks Continue Rise; "Pump and Dump Returns with Record Stock Market Highs SANTA CLARA, Calif., McAfee Labs today released the McAfee Threats Report First Quarter 2013, which reported a significant spike in instances of the Koobface social networking worm and a dramatic increase in spam.
0.562476869109293 The activities of the infamous Koobface botnet have been a frequent topic of discussion here at the Malware Blog.
0.65256905538016 The first, dubbed "Vampire", was a simulation of a full breach in which actors that pretended to be affiliated with the Koobface gang had apparently owned a number of laptops across the company (including a few of those belonging to members of the security teams), installed backdoors, had root access to the server, were actively disrupting the security teams' log searches, and ultimately sent an email containing screenshots proving the "ownage" and blackmailing the company.
0.4194423485095768 The identities of the men have been known to security researchers tracking Koobface for some time now, and the researchers have had a good handle on how the group operates, makes its money and infects users, as well.
0.1396114854099739 The individuals allegedly responsible for wreaking havoc on Facebook with the infamous Koobface botnet are living lavishly, blatantly flaunting their ill-gotten gains and taking little precautions to cover their tracks.
0.61203183337918 The KOOBFACE gang is clearly still up to no good and will most probably continue victimizing users.
0.3302682529256548 The Koobface gang made many mistakes, two of particular note: First, they enabled the mod_status module on the C&C web server, which granted any visitor public access to a live view of requests to the web server, thus revealing file and directory names.
0.354271076903842 The Koobface Gang themselves did a decent job of locking down their social media profiles, but, unfortunately, the same cannot be said of their friends and family, through whom the researchers were able to access a slew of information on the alleged.

0.1014764054064728 In one week, Luuuk trojan targeted a single European bank, not yet identified, stealing \u20ac500,000 from 190 victims in two countries.
0.687243130442033 Kaspersky Lab's experts are engaged in an on-going investigation in the Luuuk's activities.
0.4393971349299665 So we will continue our investigations based on the hypothesis that this Luuuk campaign used ZeusP2P samples for their infections and malicious transactions.
0.426153739105873 Such as Luuuk campaign , covered earlier - a long-running attack against the clients of a large European bank that resulted in the theft of half a million euros in just one week.
0.453716452106827 This additional data reinforces the theory that the Zeus family is behind the Luuuk server - in this particular case it appears to be of the ZeusP2P flavor.
0.207874797316372 This data indicated that the Luuuk server could be related to the ZeusP2P (aka Murofet), as we had originally suspected.
0.353841378955001 We decided to name this C2 luuuk after the path the administration panel used in the server: /server/adm/luuuk/.
0.4995437540427868 Yet the researchers suspect that the Luuuk masterminds merely altered their IT infrastructure, rather than shutting down their sophisticated operation.
0.4051633083074759 The actually spamming is done through a commonly associated components called Cutwail that are frequently installed on compromised PCs.
0.790070328377880 A closer inspection of the raw email indicates the message was sent from Cutwail, a botnet notorious for spamming out email with attached malware, or links to malicious sites.
0.2110967823407432 A group of saboteurs using the world's largest spam botnet, Cutwail , have opted to distribute their malware via the Magnitude exploit kit instead of through BlackHole .
0.455617849007300 A new variant of the revived Pushdo trojan has infected more than 100,000 computers since the beginning of August, and it's using a new technique to trip up researchers trying to study the botnet..
0.1441256752259690 A recent Cutwail campaign using Qantas Airlines was so convincing that Qantas issued its own warning via Facebook in December 2012: "Authentic Qantas 'Seat Selection' emails will contain your name and booking details and will not include an attachment.".
0.494945976373027 According to security firm M86 Security Labs, junk e-mail being relayed by Pushdo (a. k. a. Cutwail) tapered off from a torrent to a dribble over the past few days.

0.3883134287555757 After the initial failed attempt to regain control over their lost botnets like Srizbi, botherders stopped supporting Srizbi, and simply replaced those bots using top nodes with others like Xarvester, Cutwail, and Grum.
0.703272018212539 After the Pushdo/Cutwail, Bredolab and Rustock botnets were taken offline, the geography of spam sources underwent some major changes.
0.340409629368325 Again, it is not Exchanger which is sending the infecting spam emails, it is Rustock, Srizbi, or Pushdo.
0.0502159916041530 And even if it shrinks, repopulating it would be, most likely, fairly easy: Gameover had been disseminated via the notorious Cutwail botnet, which is still alive despite all attempts to bring it down.
0.434210064029037 And indeed, several spam campaigns are making the rounds, all related to each other and all being distributed by the criminals behind the Cutwail malware delivery infrastructure.
0.1608052532003089 Another interesting story which I would like to share with you today is that right after the Pushdo.B shutdown, FireEye received an email from a guy claiming to be Pushdo bot herder.
0.4348710749287678 As a matter of fact, the concept of keeping some backup servers outside US can also been seen even now from above list, where most of the Pushdo CnCs left alive are outside USA.
0.4069644242784743 As reported by Malcovery Security on July 22, a large spam campaign began to distribute newGOZ via the Cutwail botnet.
0.570723197280914 Before I try to answer this difficult question let's recall how other botnets including Pushdo have reacted to a shutdown attempt in past.

0.358928071756588 Botnets, however, sent about 83.2 percent of that spam, with the largest spam-wielding botnet being Cutwail.
0.768204684110826 By late October, researchers at Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) had already observed how a group of saboteurs using the world's largest spam botnet, Cutwail , had opted to distribute their malware via the Magnitude exploit kit, instead of through BlackHole.
0.2946496459885190 Come July we observed a gradual increase, which can be attributed to the use of the Cutwail botnet.
0.609667995026501 company's sensors were attributing the drop in spam to a decline in activity from the Pushdo botnet

0.0800975192789814 Cutwail uses a spammed social engineering lure to convince a user to download malware - and usually the lures are quite sophisticated and believable.
0.589532723663519 D espite Pushdo is well known, it is far from being eradicated, the malware in fact has recently infected more than 11,000 computers in just 24 hours.
0.763443639869352 Damballa learned from passive DNS analysis it conducted that PushDo was generating more than 1,300 unique domain names every day, most of these lasting just a day, cutting into the effectiveness of blacklisting operations.
0.233010778560718 Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit\u2122 (CTU) researchers have observed a shift by one of the groups using the Cutwail botnet from Blackhole to another exploit kit known in the security community as Magnitude (formerly known as Popads).
0.712608227020272 Despite the fact that an Eastern European criminal organization runs Pushdo, our tracking showed that the top 10 countries of origin for the botnet's traffic were located in either North America or Asia, one from Europe.
0.760574741634466 Distil found Pushdo traffic originating from 15,000 ISPs, hosting providers, and others, with US government and military networks among those infected with the bot malware.
0.695339909450065 "Even though the other bots that were at McColo-Rustock and Pushdo-were able to come back up, we were holding Srizbi down," Lanstein said.
0.06238566330271544 Finally, we estimate the Cutwail gang's profit for providing spam services at roughly $1.7 million to $4.2 million since June 2009 (contingent on whether bulk discounts were provided to customers)," the researchers wrote.
0.0570278972769421 Following the arrest of its creator in 2013, however, botnets such as Cutwail that relied heavily on Blackhole quickly saw a drop-off in URL and attachment spam distribution.

0.580235636132719 He made a decision to work with us in obtaining important information before shutting down all the Pushdo CnC servers in their network.
0.0797746138116162 I am sure If historians ever write about botnet take downs, they wont forget to mention the pushdo botnet.

0.736482680730279 In August, the security intelligence firm, LastLine, worked with a task force to shut down over 20 control centers used by the Pushdo / Cutwail botnet which was responsible for approximately 10% of all spam worldwide.
0.1399243602047306 In case you missed them, check out my profiles of other top botmasters, including: Mr. Waledac: The Peter North of Spamming 'Google, ' the Cutwail Botmaster Mr. Srizbi vs.
0.1048799359682216 In early June 2014, the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) research team discovered the Dyre banking trojan, which was being distributed by Cutwail botnet spam emails that included links to either Dropbox or Cubby file storage services.
0.672175098589025 In early October we observed a surge of spammed messages sent by the botnet CUTWAIL/PUSHDO , totaling to more than 18,000 messages seen in a single day.
0.1998058850487306 In May 2009, the Federal Trade Commission ordered the unplugging of a hosting provider in Northern California called 3FN, which was at the time hosting a large number of Cutwail control servers.
0.2857278179952792 In this report, we will discuss how the latest wave of Pushdo variants keep its C&C communication channel under the radar.
0.4540251626597925 Instead, the Cutwail spam contained malicious links.
0.411839633923063 It never tries to install Cutwail permanently on the infected system.
0.2330747644605766 Just a quick heads up that there is a spamming session in progress for a new variant of the old Pushdo Trojan family ( Troj/Pushdo-O ) .
0.2834444734428629 Kelihos, Cutwail botnets jump into action to deliver spam emails disguised as news from bombings.
0.2216728788131542 Koobface relies mostly on domain names to locate its CnC servers, instead of using hard coded IPs like Pushdo.
0.1548722562407389 Last month we found a very close, if not definitive, relationship between Srizbi, Pushdo, Rustock, and Mega-D. You can review our findings, as well as some of our peers confirming our discoveries below:
0.681477005371654 Let us illustrate by taking BREDO and CUTWAIL again from the previous sample.
0.2806553774770197 Many bot-infected PCs are compromised initially through a drive-by download, and attackers will then often sell access to those machines to other groups, including spammers, who will install their own malware and spam engines such as Cutwail and get to work.
0.793443040234035 More recently, Cutwail has been seen sending out malicious spam campaigns with a variety of themes such as airline ticket orders, wayward Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments, Facebook notifications , and scanned documents.
0.799692908856708 Most of the readers of this blog are already familiar with the top spam Botnets like Pushdo, Rustock, Xarvester, Srizbi, Cutwail, Mega-D/Ozdok, Waledac and their estimated sizes together being in the millions.
0.633589152796035 Neither the most sophisticated nor the hardest to shut down, Cutwail nevertheless earns its place on the list for sheer scale.
0.0669765160245712 "Nevertheless, this effort had an impact on Pushdo/Cutwail, which you can also see in new Anubis reports generated today by re-running the analysis: Many connection attempts fail and infected machines can not receive commands anymore.".
0.4563907470210596 New Analysis Shows Pushdo Botnet Sent Trillions of Spam Emails, Generated Millions in Profits.
0.267845553260061 Note: There are some exceptions to the above, as in the case recently where I saw Cutwail being distributed without the help of Pushdo, and instead using Trojan.Exchanger as the download service.
0.3061451063515151 Now an important question, will Pushdo be able to recover from this damage?
0.40532623032931 Now I will discuss some datacenters which are currently hosting Pushdo and Cutwail command/control servers.
0.433467175727644 One of the hijacked websites is misconfigured and displays the list of files on the folder of PushDo variants.
0.294259718186697 Our monitoring indicates that the volume of spam sent using the Cutwail bots has significantly decreased.
0.1029397454620000 Our researchers have observed that systems infected with Dyre are not only at risk of the malware stealing log-in credentials, but it may also receive commands to download and install additional spammers - including the Cutwail/Pushdo botnet - to more broadly propagate Dyre.
0.345974987274551 "Overall, records contained on these Cutwail servers dated as far back as June 2009 and reported 516,852,678,718 messages were accepted for delivery out of a total of 1,708,054,952,020 attempts.
0.530043159123579 Pushdo and Srizbi CnC traffic at the same time, whereas another sample of the Trojan.Exchanger.
0.416591506936638 PushDo had returned en force with a domain generation algorithm that is capable of spinning up 1,380 .com domains every day in the event its two built-in command and control servers are offline.
0.4794747493297072 Pushdo has been in the news lately as the culprit of a mass Denial of Service attack against a variety of well-known web sites.
0.333125555549095 Pushdo is a downloader Trojan used to install additional malicious software onto a victim's computer.
0.583963966749678 Pushdo is considered one of the oldest active malware families, it was also popular in the cybercrime ecosystem for delivering of spam campaigns through the Cutwail botnet , one of the largest malicious architecture in terms of the amount of infected hosts (in 2009 the botnet was composed of 1.5 - 2 million computers with a capability of sending 74 billion spam messages a day) .
0.437469922164036 Pushdo's backup servers are still alive so we need to keep an eye on Pushdo for some time like we did back in past when Rustock and Srizbi tried to escape.
0.586443654331858 Recent take-downs of large botnet command and control systems, including those of Bredolab, Waldec and Pushdo, is attributed to a brief drop in spam volumes in August and September.
0.67290848786462 Recently Cutwail has been distributed independent of Pushdo, but this gives a higher level overview of the whole operation.
0.787988536391563 Researchers at Dell SecureWorks have been tracking the new Pushdo threat since late July, according to a blog post on Friday by Stone-Gross.
0.401199624877932 Rustock is at the sixth position but still in a much better position as compared to other rival spam botnets like Pushdo and Storm 2.0.
0.57753778783817 Saboteurs behind the Pushdo botnet are sending spam to a website meant to educate users on malware, researchers have found.
0.695842735732644 Say, for example, a user scans the system and finds that it is infected with ZEUS, BREDO, and CUTWAIL.
0.280104057775056 Security researchers have dealt a mighty blow to a spam botnet known as Pushdo, a massive grouping of hacked PCs that until recently was responsible for sending more than 10 percent of all junk e-mail worldwide.
0.3942610268475330 Security researchers have extensively dissected the technical machinery that powers Cutwail (a.k.a. "Pushdo" and "Pandex"), but until now little has been published about the brains behind it.
0.573841963489904 "Serving as the underlying infrastructure for bad bots, the organization that developed and runs Pushdo stands to earn significant revenue by offering the infrastructure to the highest bidder on a revolving basis," the report noted.
0.56126886952048 showed a simple template in an earlier post , although it was not a Cutwail template.
0.552830596346391 Since late March 2014, it has been primarily distributed through malicious attachments and download links sent through the Cutwail spam botnet-the same mechanism that was so successful in spreading GameOver Zeus until it was disrupted in June.
0.201433305395098 Some of the best techical analysis of Cutwail came earlier this year in a paper from researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Ruhr-University Bochum , which described in detail how the Cutwail botnet was operated, rented and promoted on the exclusive SpamIt forums.
0.1306253252629396 Some of those include fast-flux DNS or even the use of domain generation algorithms found in the PushDo and TDSS/TDL-4 botnets.
0.68829562536125 Spammers are harnessing two venerable botnets - Kelihos and Cutwail - to send out reams of deceptive emails disguised as news and video clips from the Boston Bombing, but that carry malicious payloads.
0.4024129100733173 Takedowns such as those targeting the Rustock, Waledac and Cutwail botnets are important tactics in the fight against spam, malware and other forms of online crime.
0.1295798665986259 That's the main reason we see different variants of Cutwail in circulation.
0.1513966739140569 The added domain generation algorithm capabilities enable PushDo, which can also be used to drop any other malware, to further conceal itself.
0.2268031794842800 The attackers were using the Cutwail spam botnet to distribute CryptoWall via the Upatre downloader, which calls out to sites hosting the ransomware and downloads it to a compromised machine.
0.2505472519633814 The Botnet connections appear to go deeper - we have discovered that there is a direct connection between Storm, Pushdo and Trojan.Exchanger as well.
0.796312328224567 The chats were later leaked online, and provide a rare glimpse into the day-to-day operations of Cutwail from the botmaster's perspective.
0.3779436684410336 "The Cutwail spam engine is known in spam forums by the name 0bulk Psyche Evolution , where it is rented to a community of spam affiliates.
0.1711418632602926 The Cutwail spambot has a long history of sending spam with attached malicious files such as Zbot, Blackhole Exploit Kit and Cryptolocker.
0.0438871945977111 The Cutwail/Pushdo botnet is one of the more well-known and well-researched botnets in operation right now, and several different groups of researchers have attempted to disrupt its operations or take it down completely, with varying degrees of success.
0.732435618079067 The experts at Malcovery noted that all the spam campaigns observed have a common origin, they are all being distributed by the criminals behind the Cutwail malware delivery infrastructure.
0.745772822991772 The groups behind the Cutwail botnet, also known as Pushdo, for example, may have occasionally paid as much as $15,000 to maintain the botnet's low-six-figure size, but likely made $1.7 million to $4.3 million over nearly two years, according to a 2011 paper written by a group of academic security researchers.
0.1210054420356059 The hackers behind the Gameover variant of the popular Zeus banking Trojan have rented the massive Cutwail botnet in order to send out millions of fake emails carrying the malware, warns Dell SecureWorks' Counter Threat Unit.
0.3746756458431236 The last post in this series introduced the world to "Google," an alias chosen by the hacker in charge of Cutwail - currently the world's largest spam botnet.
0.297326482244064 The last two binaries listed above are what we'll deep dive into, as those are the ones which further download Storm variants, Pushdo, Exchanger, and XPAntiVirus-2008.
0.664768196621351 The latter has been the primary mode of distribution since march with the Cutwail spam botnet being used to send download links, typically through the Upatre downloader which famously distributed Gameover Zeus until Operation Tovar took it down.
0.066149989575704 The Magnitude version of Cutwail asks the user to click to install a browser update, but instead, the user unknowingly installs Gameover Zeus.
0.34154089872699 The majority of the malicious spam comes from the Cutwail botnet, although Festi and Asprox are among the other contributors," M86 researcher Rodel Mendrez said in a blog post.
0.3932265291736990 The Pushdo downloader (or loader) is primarily used to download and install the Cutwail spam bot engine.
0.3448754723799113 The Pushdo malware detects when users are running a malware monitoring too called FakeNet, and goes on to spam the site, researchers found.
0.716847934806132 The Pushdo / Srizbi connection is already known and well documented, but sharing the same server also shows a lack of resources on the part of the Bot herders.
0.63035072273248 The Pushdo/Cutwail and Bredolab botnet command centers have been shut down; the SpamIt partner program went out of business; and a criminal case has been brought against Igor Gusev who is believed to be the world's No.1 spammer.
0.58143161643648 The recent Cutwail/Pushdo takedown was a great help on stopping this huge botnet in sending spammed messages all over the world.
0.135447302926136 The same holds for Cutwail but in my opinion, in this case Cutwail CnC servers don't matter a lot.
0.475776208146892 The spam is sent via the infamous Cutwail botnet and is designed to look like official correspondence from banks and government agencies (see image below).
0.156492929859716 The uptick in Pushdo infections on Aug. 26 was likely attributable to a short-lived spam campaign, which could potentially rear its head again.
0.4524546168400368 There is no rush as Pushdo backup servers are still up and running.
0.4573338703180741 These affiliates pay a fee to Cutwail botmasters in order to use their botnet infrastructure.
0.45663303600523 These massive volumes are largely fueled by botnets such as Grum and Cutwail, creating all types of problems for business networks large and small.
0.3104768500957124 These top level malware droppers might again drop another instance of pushdo on to the infected machine, reporting to a completely different IP block.
0.2808295811238883 This begs the question: Why would a single binary download Storm and Pushdo, if they were in fact, competing Botnets?
0.591103037150180 This last wave of attack demonstrates the intense activity of cybercrime that is able to resume and improve also older cyber threats like Pushdo trojan, making life harder for law enforcement agencies.
0.610678127448173 This means that shutting down this server (or servers depending on different samples) would stop the distribution of spam templates, and hence worldwide SPAM from Cutwail.
0.2195921048557587 This move was so confusing that some people named it as Pushdo DDOSing .
0.59879534775355 This spam mail appears to be associated with the Cutwail botnet, which is the second-most prolific botnet in detected infections.
0.0528060359573581 This version of PushDo was generating between nine- and 12-character dot-com domains.
0.512154224301474 This week, Dell SecureWorks, Damballa Lab and Georgia Tech University combined on a research report exposing the fact that PushDo, a Trojan dropper largely responsible for Cutwail, one of the largest spam-producing botnets on record, was back.
0.4573549326559339 Trend Micro has observed this CTB-Locker variant being distributed through spam, and some samples were sent by systems that are part of the Cutwail botnet, the post indicates, going on to state that the ransomware is predominately impacting users in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), China, Latin America and India.
0.1839404151146084 Trustwave customers using the MailMarshal Secure Email Gateway, and Secure Web Gateway, were protected from the Cutwail spam, and Blackhole landing pages respectively.
0.0742840813965781 UpClicker, PushDo, and Nap are just some of the resurrected advanced malware that use evasion techniques against file-based sandboxes.
0.225923093891846 Utilities are mostly plagued by a family of Trojans called Redyms (26%), which redirect search engine results, Zeus (15%), Zero Access (13%), Cutwail (8%), and Confickr (8%).
0.621263503481942 Very soon after joining SpamIt, SPM identifies Google - the Cutwail botmaster - as his main competitor, and sets off to undermine Google and to become the default spam software provider to SpamIt.
0.364023373360005 Was this take down targeting Pushdo, Cutwail, or both botnets?
0.513992531750802 We also identified two new PushDo variants that pushed victims from several hijacked websites.
0.0438736724392576 We can clearly see that Srizibi, Pushdo and Rustock are using same ISP, and in many cases, IPs on the same subnet to host their Command and Control servers.
0.0827288132469545 We have already seen similar relationships among the top spam Botnets like Pushdo, Srizbi, Cutwail, Mega-D/Ozdok, and Rustock.
0.1745330473689462 We have already seen that Pushdo is one of the active members of Virut , Bredolab and Exchanger botnetwebs .
0.700232862338826 We know that the Cutwail spammers who were using the BlackHole Exploit server were the primary folks who were sending out all of those malicious LinkedIn emails, so have the top threats changed since Paunch and friends were arrested in October and the Black Hole Exploit server started drying up?
0.781460757151818 Wei Wang, RAP Team Jia Wang, RAP Team Jiaying Su, RAP Team First discovered in 2007, the botnet malware known as Pushdo quickly became known as one of the most prolific sources of email spam in history.
0.792993206821898 We've seen a number of these malware emails come via botnets, especially the Cutwail botnet.
0.1852608331055313 What I was going to write about was how Rustock changed its Command and Control server to an IP previously used by Pushdo/Cutwail.
0.590970455228382 What sets this Pushdo variant apart is an embedded malware module that generates fake HTTP GET/POST requests to a large list of legitimate (non-compromised) websites.
0.511865717315648 Whether they're designed to cause destructive chaos (like Shamoon ) or fly under the radar (like PushDo ), they're tough to contain, categorize and catalog.
0.1984117922839944 While that's an interesting development, it remains to be seen whether they will prove to be beneficial techniques over the long term for giving new life to botnets like PushDo.
0.2149601011363856 With the recent takedown of the Rustock botnet , Cutwail now is the top spam bot; according to M86 Security , versions of Cutwail are responsible for about 22 percent of the daily spam volumes worldwide.
0.665743074279720 Within a few months of the takedown, which involved removing a slew of C&C servers from the loop, spam levels from Cutwail were climbing again.
0.3380208808468969 Yesterday, Dell SecureWorks and Damballa reported [PDF] that a variant of the PushDo malware added a new feature - a fallback mechanism for situations when the C&C server is not accessible.
0.149100011084526 You may remember hearing about Domain Generating Algorithms, aka DGAs, from our coverage of the PushDo malware or from the malware we dubbed DGA.Changer , or more recently from our post on the Tinba Trojan .
0.558930391323257 A Trend Micro research paper, On the Actors Behind MEVADE/SEFNIT , speaks at length about this adware-malware connection.
0.2946519512464136 At least it did until 2013 when it crossed the line to become outright malware by installing SEFNIT/MEVADE on user's systems without their consent.
0.2146579791539692 But Tor is still too slow and massive botnets may have an impact on the performances of the overall network as observed for the Mevade botnet, in this case the botnet is very noisy and easy to destroy.
0.730548159633048 Feedback provided by the Smart Protection Network shows that the Mevade malware was, indeed, downloading a Tor module in the last weeks of August and early September.
0.1882786764480650 Finally, it's also noteworthy that our Smart Protection Network data showed practically no SEFNIT/MEVADE infections in Israel where iBario is based.
0.64031173193025 Fox-IT researchers say that the Mevade botnet is massive and has be around quite some time.
0.3463125686031942 In June, Microsoft was among the first to develop a detection signature for MEvade and within two weeks, the attackers changed domain usage tactics, moving to dynamic DNS providers such as No-IP and ChangeIP, likely to support their use of SSH over HTTP ports for communication with command and control and dropping of additional malware.
0.2245572436507444 In June the researchers uncovered a click fraud component which they at first classified as Mevade, the malware credited with being responsible for a 600% increase in Tor network connections that was first thought to be blowback from the NSA revelations causing more people to utilize Tor's anonymizing features.
0.621632471924846 In September, we blogged about the Mevade malware that downloaded a Tor component for backup command and control (C&C) communication.
0.2515480330495074 In the last months security experts have found different malware variants abusing Tor network to create bulletproof botnets including Skynet , Mevade and Atrax.
0.687893086743810 Is the Mevade malware the real responsible for the spike observed in the number of users directly connected to the Tor network?
0.68721303650463 "Last week we concluded, after further review, that Mevade and Sefnit are the same family and our detections for Mevade have now been moved to join the Sefnit family," McDonald wrote.
0.3446640098101255 Members of the Tor Project began an investigation into the spike in usage confirming that millions of new Tor clients were part of a Mevade botnet as they have explained in a Tor officials wrote in a blog post :
0.1114365856987985 Mevade , one of the more popular Tor-based botnets gained unwanted publicity when it shifted to the covert communication protocol at the end of this past summer.
0.156264517762152 MEvade, the massive botnet using Tor as a communication protocol, may have moved operations to the network in order to hamper potential takedown efforts, but according to security researchers, the move just served to shine a spotlight on the botnet's activities.
0.792933584335634 Mevade was a botnet that installed a Tor module and monetized its activities by delivering malware.
0.349946676865643 Mevade.A, a network of infected computers dating back to at least 2009, has mainly used standard Web-based protocols to send and receive data to command and control (C&C) servers, according to researchers at security firm Fox-IT.
0.1806966892759036 Originally, Microsoft said, it had classified the click-fraud portion of Sefnit as the Mevade malware; it now considers them to be of the same family.
0.419228887555989 Other ADW_BRANTALL variants are known to push malware, specifically MEVADE/SEFNIT malware to computers.
0.646054461970152 Our research shows clear ties between the threat actors behind SEFNIT/MEVADE based in Ukraine and iBario, maker of InstallBrain, based in Israel.
0.0706122706382437 Researcher Mark Gilbert told Threatpost that the botmaster was likely renting out portions of the Mevade botnet for click-fraud, adware scams and even data exfiltration.
0.518138831555013 Researchers speculate the Mevade gang moved the botnet to Tor to hamper takedown attempts by law enforcement, but all they did was spike Tor traffic literally overnight, alerting Tor handlers to the illicit activity.
0.3121751913814627 Security researchers at Fox-IT firm found evidence that the spike in Tor traffic is caused by a Mevade botnet that hides its C&C in the anonymizing network.
0.4571569835460549 The malware isn't the first agent that adopted as communication channel the Tor network, we found in the past other botnets exploiting the same trick to high malicious traffic, recently Mevade was responsible for the spike in the Tor traffic, while going further back in time we can mention Skynet The Atrax crime kit is cheap, it is available for runs about $250, and appears very attractive due a series of features like Bitcoin mining , Litecoin mining, browser data extraction and a component to launch DDoS attacks .
0.2265180698261739 The Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) has concluded that Mevade is not, as some supposed, a new family of malware, but a new generation of the what they call Win32/Sefnit , a well-known click fraud botnet that had been presumed inactive since 2011.
0.2043654617476875 Tor capability was added to a 64-bit version of Zeus recently, and both the crimeware kit Atrax and the botnet-based Mevade became known because of that functionality.
0.04751961419815009 Trend Micro researchers discovered that this increase in the number of TOR users was due to infections of SEFNIT/MEVADE, which has TOR components.
0.604554493542565 (We will release a second blog post describing in more detail the behavior of the Mevade variants we have encountered.).
0.357183098397227 We would also like to point out that Mevade also has a backdoor component and communicates over SSH to remote hosts.
0.2399031912543988 While InstallBrain is reported to exhibit rootkit capabilities to hook deep into the operating system, hijack browsers, and interfere with the user experience, it hasn't been considered malicious until its association with SEFNIT/MEVADE.
0.4679567980112545 An Android plugged into a computer could intercept all network traffic to and from that machine, for instance, and Nohl said there isn't much you can do to prevent BadUSB attacks.
0.727224165876725 At the Black Hat conference in August, security researcher Karsten Nohl demonstrated an emerging risk on the cyber threat landscape that he dubbed "BadUSB": virtually unpatchable malware that resides in the core of a USB device, rewrites its firmware to stay undetected by anti-virus products, and proceeds to infect everything that it attaches to.
0.78773638057925 BadUSB was capable to spread itself by hiding in the firmware meant to control the ways in which USB devices connect to computers.
0.533981121003652 But the BadUSB paper wasn't about how to unlock some hidden features in your latest digital camera.
0.0953261670804104 It's clear that what Nohl suggest is quite impossible to realize, so the researcher decided not to release the proof-of-concept code for his BadUSB attack when he demonstrated it at Black Hat.
0.6720420304496 Now that BadUSB is on the loose, the implications of this type of malware cannot be underestimated.
0.4993840443947452 Rarely in security is anything an absolute, but in the case of the BadUSB research that emerged during this year's Black Hat conference, phrases such as "completely compromised" and "undetectable" paint a grim picture for the security of devices that communicate over USB.
0.1952199415845391 "Simply reinstalling the operating system - the standard response to otherwise ineradicable malware - does not address BadUSB infections at their root," Nohl said. "The USB thumb drive, from which the operating system is reinstalled, may already be infected, as may the hardwired webcam or other USB components inside the computer. A BadUSB device may even have replaced the computer's BIOS - again by emulating a keyboard and unlocking a hidden file on the USB thumb drive."
0.0779270886505543 The company Imation already implemented a solution to protect its users against the BadUSB attacks , its solution Ironkey requires that any new updates to its chip firmware be digitally signed with an unforgeable cryptographic signature.
0.726452835112777 That's the interesting part of what we're calling the VirRansom threat, which is detcted and blocked by Sophos as W32/VirRnsm-A .

0.356896499187530 European and Asian organisations were targeted by the CozyDuke advanced persistent threat (APT) attack, revealed an executive with Kaspersky Lab.
0.75885376112396 F-Secure Labs' latest malware analysis focuses on CozyDuke - an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) toolkit that uses combinations of tactics and malware to compromise and steal information from its targets.
0.0672677126543059 Just because threats like CozyDuke target organizations rather than individual citizens doesn't mean that they don't put regular people at risk.
0.549803544980302 The attackers establish a beachhead in an organization by tricking employees into doing something such as clicking a link in an e-mail that distracts users with a decoy file (like a PDF or a video), allowing CozyDuke to infect systems without being noticed.
0.474924924527970 "The interesting thing about CozyDuke is that it's being used against a more diverse range of targets.
0.667698631268552 "In our view, the hypothesis with the highest probability is that groups of attackers share resources leading to overlaps - this appears to be an ever more common feature - with malware families, builders, and even sometimes hosting infrastructure being shared between disparate actors with a common goal," Doman and Lancaster said. "Sharing frameworks like ScanBox or other exploit kits allows less sophisticated actors (who were themselves unable to develop a tool like ScanBox) to conduct better attacks."
0.4352558873875742 Instead, attackers using watering hole attacks, were loading malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website; the JavaScript, i.e., ScanBox, was a keylogger that snagged all of a user's typed activity on the infected watering hole website.
0.4507558649556576 Scanbox also include keylogging capability, when visitors browse the compromised website, all keystrokes are being recorded and sent to the C&C server periodically, t he IP address that is hosting the command and control server is 122.10.9.109 and is assigned to a data center located in Hong Kong.
0.3388120441329194 Scanbox has numerous plugins that could be used to Enumerates software installed in the system (e.g. Flash versions, Flash versions, etc.).
0.214385009425166 "ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn't require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information - the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser," wrote Chris Doman and Tom Lancaster of PwC.
0.508705312511857 ScanBox, reported by AlienVault Labs in August, is primarily a reconnaissance tool that, in addition to the keylogger, enumerates software installed on the system, including security software, Adobe Flash and Reader versions, Office version and Java versions.
0.305998209150993 "Sharing frameworks like ScanBox or other exploit kits allows less sophisticated actors (who were themselves unable to develop a tool like ScanBox) to conduct better attacks.".
0.424747531875562 The attackers deployed a malicious JavaScript on the targeted website, but this attack delivers a framework called Scanbox instead a malware, the application simply collects data from the host and send it to the command and control server, in particular, it is able to detect the applications running on the targeted machine and information that could be used later by an attacker to serve specific exploits.
0.174014386312682 Their published report Monday revealed four separate attacks-each carried out by different attackers-using ScanBox against varied targets.

0.697859730804608 A portion of the ZeroAccess botnet was recently taken down by Symantec, but it's estimated to be present in 2.2 to 1.9 million computers on any given day, making it the most pervasive botnet to date.
0.655314419453384 According to the paper, ZeroAccess maintains its peer lists by updating them every few seconds and merging previous lists, keeping the 256 most recent peers.
0.488995788880592 According to Trend Micro numbers, Sirefef/Zaccess infections have hugely increased in July, going from some 1,000 infected computers on the first of the month to over 11,000 on the 27th.
0.0495276667264190 After being disrupted by law enforcement in December 2013, the peer-to-peer (P2P) ZeroAccess botnet - also known as Sirefef - has resumed advertising click fraud activities, according to the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU).
0.1021163775614303 After Lee's talk, SophosLabs UK researcher James Wyke was up with his talk, "Back channels and bitcoins: ZeroAccess' secret C&C communications", where he dove into the latest developments he has uncovered about the Zero Access botnet.
0.1673357691074873 Afterward, we used that new information and applied it to a ZeroAccess Trojan titled new-sirefef.exe.
0.1525531563690428 Also noted in the quarterly report was an increase in ZeroAccess malware, which is popular on peer-to-peer networks and now able to patch system files.
0.1295578151015349 Among the biggest threats to consumers was the ZeroAccess botnet, which grew to more than 1.2 million super nodes resulting in ad-click fraud that at one point burned through bandwidth equivalent to 45 monthly movie downloads per subscriber.
0.0992586546981142 And, since the operators of ZeroAccess do not have pay the cost of the electricity needed to run the botnet, the activity is profitable, Richard Henderson, security strategist with Fortinet, told eWEEK .
0.4044055199444912 At the moment ZeroAccess appears segmented into two distinct botnets that operate separately with Windows systems running on a 32-bit architecture and on a 64-bit architecture.
0.2892598795038925 Authors of Blackhole profit by delivering multi-platform payloads for different cyber threats from fake antivirus and ransomware to Zeus and the infamous TDSS and ZeroAccess rootkits.
0.0803391775865264 Basically, instead of loading a Win32 EXE into another process's memory space, ZeroAccess prepares a customized stack and inserts that into another process's context, where it gets executed according to the sequence in the stack.
0.1283217400524213 "Because of the sophistication of the threat, Microsoft and its partners do not expect to fully eliminate the ZeroAccess botnet," the blog states.
0.350586898155120 Because the COM object that ZeroAccess creates is a user object, Windows will load it before the legitimate object located in the registry under HKCR.

0.221217210821672 Boscovich compared the ZeroAccess botnet to the Bamital botnet , which was taken down in early February by the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit in collaboration with Symantec.
0.652185247965694 Botnets such as ZeroAccess, TDL4/TDSS and Zeus v3 have shown the way for peer-to-peer botnet builders, either as a primary means of communication between hackers and bots, or as a fallback in case centralized communication is disrupted or permanently terminated.
0.3801969935984753 by Alcatel-Lucent subsidiary Kindsight, as much as 10 percent of home networks and over 0.5 percent of mobile devices are infected with malware, and the ZeroAccess botnet continues to be the most common malware threat, infecting 0.8 percent of broadband users.
0.0765802664602979 Currently, the ZeroAccess botnet's infection base is around 55,000 systems, which is considerably lower than the reported two million systems that were infected when the botnet was taken down at the end of 2013, Jeff Williams, director of security strategy with the Dell SecureWorks CTU, told SCMagazine.com on Friday.

0.744239861873217 Due to the continued high profile of this malware family we felt it was necessary to examine the threat in greater detail, not only the latest version of ZeroAccess, but also the ZeroAccess botnet as a whole.
0.1010903290975954 During last quarter it has been observed a meaningful increase in ZeroAccess malware, that is reached first place in rankings with more than 900,000 detections.
0.2410907878159250 Earlier in 2013, FortiGuard Labs reported on the ZeroAccess botnet and how its controllers were systematically adding about 100,000 new infections weekly, leading researchers to believe that the person or persons behind it were not only paying a substantial amount of money weekly to generate new affiliate infections, but that they were able to make a significant amount of money doing so.
0.2008320882439401 Early December last year, Microsoft - in cooperation with certain law enforcement agencies - announced their takedown of the ZeroAccess operations.
0.722191938206736 Early versions of ZeroAccess relied on a series of control servers to receive updates, but recent versions of the botnet malware were designed to make the network as a whole more resilient and resistant to targeted takedowns such as the one executed this week.
0.657460344462021 Engineered to be tough against efforts to take it down, Boscovich explained that ZeroAccess relies on a peer-to-peer infrastructure.
0.459435406970925 Even after ZeroAccess was removed, Fortinet reported that attacks were quickly back up to normal .

0.073169456392242 Here at SophosLabs we have previously written in great depth about the menace of the ZeroAccess malware family, exploring its nature and documenting the changes this malware family has gone through over time.
0.334211425227013 Honestly, why I did not see ANY downtime of these ZeroAccess peer communication?
0.512385814969555 However, authors of Sirefef malware often come up with more interesting methods of loading their programs, and we will look at their method in this blog post.
0.2327172319907726 However, the legal and technological measures taken, they believe, will significantly disrupt ZeroAccess, prevent victim machines from contributing to its illicit behavior, and likely cause the botnet's operators to rebuild.
0.626130782285473 However, the rule that was triggered in this particular alert contained a threshold that suppressed alerts for ZeroAccess traffic to other IP addresses.
0.78266997713175 If Microsoft is correct, ZeroAccess is one of the first peer-to-peer botnets to be shut down in such an effort.
0.1845415058644647 If the exploit kit succeeds in taking advantage of a vulnerability on the victims' computer, they are saddled with Pony Loader and Sirefef Trojans, and the Nymaim ransomware, which locks their computer and demands $300 to unlock it.
0.431048941999780 If you'd like to do your bit to help rid the world of botnets like ZeroAccess then prevention is easier than cure; you can make a big difference just by doing 3 essential security tasks for your family today .

0.421106188926794 Image: F-Secure In the ZeroAccess sample discovered by Sophos, the malware obfuscated the registry key value for the malware's service, called 'gupdate'.
0.496542668058535 In a race to get one step ahead of the botnet operators, researchers at Symantec made the move to sinkhole ZeroAccess bots when they discovered that the botnet's operators were about to push a new version of the malware that fixed weaknesses that allow the botnet to be intercepted and sinkholed.
0.513796296388518 In recent years, however, the miscreants behind ZeroAccess rearchitected the botnet so that infected systems were forced to perpetrate a moneymaking scheme known as "click fraud" - the practice of fraudulently generating clicks on ads without any intention of fruitfully interacting with the advertiser's site.
0.526340165321800 Infamous malware families remain alive and well: Sality, Sirefef, Virut, Zbot, Wimad, and even Conficker, each were detected targeting Windows machines tens of millions of times between the period of September 1, 2013 and January 25, 2014, according to data from Microsoft from its real-time detection scans.
0.0680381355017121 - is actually malware closely related to the ZeroAccess Trojan, whose main goal is to hide itself on the infected computer, enslave it into a botnet, and surreptitiously click on online ads on the behalf of the computer owner and thus earn money for the botnet owner(s).
0.731745077781498 It could either be the same malware writer providing malware to different cybercrime gangs, or that ZeroAccess took over the Tidserve code, according to Symantec.
0.148427399043179 It remains unclear how much this coordinated action will impact the operations of ZeroAccess over the long term.
0.4486044266189459 It's also interesting to note that ZeroAccess has been known to disable TDSS if it discovers it on a computer it compromised, which would seem to imply the two rootkits (and the gangs propagating them) are rivals.
0.407509005115200 It's not just the victims of ZeroAccess that pay the price, Blizard and Livic explain: "The advertisers who are paying for clicks which are never generated by potential customers are also affected," they say. "And this lost revenue is passed on to you, the customer. When you buy a product whose ad budget is being stolen, you fractionally bear this cost."
0.725643621476074 It's not the first time that Microsoft is involved in the operation against the cybercrime on a large scale, in December 2013 the company in a joint operation with FBI, Europol and industry partners has decapitated the ZeroAccess botnet that hijacks search results.
0.355851457796332 Jay & I have read and blogged a great deal about ZeroAccess over the past year and finally had the chance to see a live slice of how pervasive (and, noisy) the network is even with just a view from a few infected nodes.
0.0869323002495180 Kindsight counts more than two million ZeroAccess infections on any given day and added that 600,000 of those are in the United States.
0.3497288136889419 Kindsight said the botmasters own a number of sites that host pay-per-click ads and the ZeroAccess bots are programmed to click on ads hosted on these sites.
0.63137792907208 Last week, Microsoft filed a civil suit against the cybercriminals operating the ZeroAccess botnet and received authorization from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas to simultaneously block incoming and outgoing communications between computers located in the U.S. and the 18 identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses being used to commit the fraudulent schemes.
0.513520554148872 Last year, SophosLabs researchers published a technical paper about ZeroAccess - a botnet which had managed to infect over its lifespan nine million PCs around the world, but was now one million computers strong and mostly based in the United States.
0.2259938491476014 Like "Chameleon", ZeroAccess earns money through click fraud (and it also has a sideline in Bitcoin mining) - we estimated at the time it was making almost $3 million per month.
0.1703220319206053 Meanwhile, FortiGuard Labs also noted that the ZeroAccess botnet continued to systematically add about 100,000 new infections weekly, leading researchers to believe that the person or persons behind it were not only paying a substantial amount of money weekly to generate new affiliate infections, but that they were able to make a significant amount of money doing so.

0.3354939811405719 Proof of this nefarious deal between these two notorious botnets can be seen in the redirection URLs used by ZeroAccess.
0.648856247325191 QUERVAR was seen widespread in the NABU, EMEA, and ANZ regions, ransomware malware family has been prominent in EMEA, while SIREFEF or ZACCESS has been rampant in NABU..
0.56727683970026 Recent research examined the resilience of peer to peer botnets, in particular Kelihos, ZeroAccess and Zeus, and found a number of reasons why it has legs.
0.606811940065936 Recently I wrote a blog post about a legitimate website spreading Sirefef malware .
0.764839192179994 Researchers say that the ZeroAccess administrators did not attempt to expand the botnet after the big disruption in December 2013.
0.753558915145426 Reversal of fortune: Sirefef's registry illusion - 2013-09-19 - Malware Protection Center - Microsoft.
0.0780724858321399 Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel with Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit , estimated that ZeroAccess cost online advertisers upwards of $2.7 million each month.
0.434600524706181 Sality also has some staying power with versions maintaining a working presence since 2007; ZeroAccess versions have been active continuously since 2009.
0.4955137516600508 Security company Damballa, for one, is reporting that Microsoft targeted only the click-fraud component of the botnet and not the custom communication protocol used by ZeroAccess to distribute configuration files and new commands.
0.331238014609483 Similar to Microsoft's Citadel botnet case, the ZeroAccess case is part of an extensive cooperative effort with international law enforcement and industry partners to dismantle cybercriminal networks and ensure that people worldwide can use their computing devices and services with confidence.
0.3196998693830984 Similar to Sality, ZeroAccess can use downloaded malware plug-ins to recover from a sinkhole attack if necessary.
0.4384344325779515 Since FortiGuard Labs began actively monitoring ZeroAccess in August 2012, the team has seen a virtually linear amount of growth in new infections.
0.537112252574979 Sirefef malware is still holding on, but Batchelder says it's on its way to extinction thanks to the team effort to dismantle it.
0.683869112248196 SophosLabs has been monitoring a new strain of the infamous ZeroAccess rootkit that has been hitting the internet over the last few weeks.
0.1558135111515570 SophosLabs researchers can reveal that the current version of ZeroAccess has been installed on computers over nine million times with the current number of active infected PCs numbering around one million.
0.537030757878283 Statistics from Microsoft and Europol estimate there were nearly two million compromised computers at the disposal of the ZeroAccess botmaster, who was collecting close to $3 million monthly in fraudulent advertising.
0.642242244053816 Sweet, those IP's are most likely infected with ZeroAccess as well.
0.1569375567391366 Taking them down will undoubtedly cause disruption and a loss of revenue to the people behind ZeroAccess but the botnet itself is still in tact.
0.382883691492216 That was the case this week, when researcher Giuseppe Bonfa published a detailed analysis of a ubiquitous and very complex piece of malware known as ZeroAccess.
0.637069109127553 The company also took control of 49 domains associated with ZeroAccess.
0.3046222816158331 The Cutwail emails often included links that would lead victims to sites hosting Blackhole, which would then inject downloaders for other malware such as ZeroAccess or Zeus.
0.511094079938648 The decentralized arrangement meant ZeroAccess was immune to traditional sinkholing operations that seize control of the IP addresses or domain names the bots access to receive instructions and software updates.
0.286454787109255 The Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team observed the ZeroAccess botnet resumes again with click-fraud activity.
0.3748369065111828 The files and data directories contain the exploits ( cve-2012-1723, cve-2012-0507, cve-2010-1885, cve-2012-4681 , cve-2010-0188) and the payload (ZeroAccess among other malware, which is memory resident rootkit (thus no 'dropped', created files for ZeroAccess in the package, only the original dropper and all kinds of files genereated by the clickfraud component.
0.576399442024789 The font malware is especially interesting because the Duqu exploit is currently being included in mass exploitation kits alongside widespread Java and Adobe Reader exploits to spread Ransomware, ZeroAccess, and other trojans of all sorts.
0.316316977265290 The goal of the exploit is to silently drop the ZeroAccess rootking and an (also poorly detected) fake AV variant that goes by the name of Internet Security Pro.
0.226781545044420 The latest entry into the field is an x64 version of the ZeroAccess rootkit, a nasty piece of malware that's been circulating for some time and has a number of interesting capabilities, including anti-forensics and kernel-level monitoring.
0.1522822919976444 The majority of the infected ZeroAccess bots are consumer machines, anywhere from 80- to 90 percent, and Symantec has been working with ISPs and CERTS around the world to share information about the botnet so the infected machines can be cleaned up.
0.0444817320764914 The name ZeroAccess derives from a string found in the kernel driver code that is pointing to the original project folder called ZeroAccess , it is distributed through several means including compromised websites, redirecting traffic to malicious websites that host the trojan and distribute it using exploit kit such as the Blackhole Exploit Toolkit .
0.486438233602534 The newly disrupted ZeroAccess botnet was previously spotted putting a new spin on infecting a user: injecting itself into the download process of Adobe Flash.
0.730358913971753 The news this week revolved around complex and troublesome threats, notably two rootkits, TDL4 and ZeroAccess.
0.0614893682002346 The operation took down more than half a million ZeroAccess bots - only a percentage of the total number of bots controlled by the botmaster.
0.0561264824460446 The partial takedown of ZeroAccess, one of the world's largest botnets, is an example of the role that collaboration between business and law enforcement can play in battling cybercrime.
0.1814221325268026 The Sirefef registry entry will show up as "etadpug" and the key will contain a slew of random characters rather than the description of the legitimate Google Update service.
0.523414498896279 The United States of ZeroAccess / ZeroAccess: We're Gonna Need a Bigger Planet - 2012-09-17 - FSecure.
0.1182451614192969 The value of the decentralized, open source-based digital currency continues to skyrocket, which likely means the amount of money being made by ZeroAccess is in the millions of dollars or more.
0.623232769270491 The ZeroAcces (or Sirefef) rootkit ropes the infected computer into a peer-to-peer botnet that is currently being used for click fraud and Bitcoin mining.
0.3578931026948235 The ZeroAccess botnet has also been leveraged by criminals to amass Bitcoins via Bitcoin mining .
0.791154944483364 "The ZeroAccess botnet is still under the control of the original actors," says Keith Jarvis, Dell SecureWorks CTU security researcher. "They haven't moved any bots, this just happens to be the geographic distribution of the residual infected hosts still remaining in the botnet."
0.0484216276160481 The ZeroAccess rootkit has been around for quite some time now, spying on infected users, hiding from installed AV solutions and attempting to terminate them, redirecting users' online searches to malicious pages, downloading additional malware, and waiting for commands from criminals..
0.162082167982694 The ZeroAccess rootkit is being used as a platform for installing fake AV programs on infected machines as part of a campaign that demands victims pay a $70 fee to remove the unwanted software, Bonfa found.
0.1082058696722666 The ZeroAccess rootkit isn't the most well-known or closely watched piece of malware in recent history, but, as an extremely detailed new analysis of the program shows, it is a perfect example of the kind of sophisticated malware that attack crews are using to maintain persistent, silent access to compromised machines.
0.520248354397341 "There has been some analysis that we did, and it seems that it came from the Nuclear [Pack] attack kit, serving the ZeroAccess malware," Peck said.
0.1725709343874746 "They are so confident that they are charging five times the going rate [for infections]," Henderson said. "They are paying them $500 per 1,000 infections. As soon as the [ZeroAccess] infection takes place, they are already paid. They must have a lot of money in the bank to do this, so they are making a lot off of the ZeroAccess botnet."
0.188477229400342 This is a simple Windows batch file ZeroAccess used to use to remove itself after execution, as a fast and simple way to hide any traces of its presence from the user (click for larger view): Lots of other malware use this batch file self-deletion method.
0.514049897106423 This is now used by other malware families as well, including ZeroAccess and TDSS.
0.720684139724146 This picture is a graphical representation of the execution path for a key ZeroAccess driver, which is dropped on infected systems and used to support the stealth features and functionality of the malware, which is used to install fake antivirus software and other crimeware.
0.0926540653850748 Though the ZeroAccess takedown was disruptive to TDSS money-making schemes, its infections and communications remained business-as-usual, which means the TDSS botnet is likely profiting from other botnets.
0.2287891707440197 Users who wish to protect themselves against the rootkit (and other malware) are advised to install a reputable AV solution and keep it up to date, as most of them detect the various ZeroAccess variants..
0.642112856392968 Using Virus Total Intelligence Hunting to find ZeroAccess and Solarbot malware YARA is also used in another popular malware analysis tool known as Cuckoo Sandbox, a free, open-source python-based Sandbox that runs on GNU/Linux systems.
0.149183365199720 We also noticed that TDSS malware, in particular versions DGAv14 use the old ZeroAccess domain generation algorithm (DGA) module, while new ZeroAccess variants has adopted DGAv14 features.
0.3903777684132091 We estimated that the ZeroAccess botnet managed to infect over 9 million machines and the number of Gameover infections was also in the millions.
0.2397188442950144 "We see that kind of behavior about 20 percent of the time: seeing the thing that got dropped by the original malware, without seeing the original malware right away. ZeroAccess is an example of where the actual initial threat goes undetected, but we see the stuff that gets on after that point," he says. "It happens very frequently that we see the detection taking place and there's a actually a broader infection under that initial detection."
0.3043783262119531 While the power of the ZeroAccess botnet-even with millions of infected computers-is less than some of the specialized bitcoin mining hardware platforms, the botnet is likely successfully mining bitcoins.
0.748094627492258 While this effort will not disable the ZeroAccess botnet (the infected systems will likely remain infected), it should allow Microsoft to determine which online affiliates and publishers are associated with the miscreants behind ZeroAccess, since those publishers will have stopped sending traffic directly after the takedown occurred.

0.279981837299793 With the dramatic rise in Bitcoin value over 2013, it's likely that the owners of ZeroAccess have profited substantially on the backs of their victims.".
0.219065822854631 "You can look for [related] behaviors to ZeroAccess," for example, in other files, he says.
0.3818044358755 ZeroAccess, a kernel-mode rootkit, recently shifted its infection technique from kernel mode to user mode.
0.544211764373993 ZeroAccess also had previously been used for Bitcoin-mining , but the gang earlier this year got out of the business of mining the virtual currency and doubled down on its click-fraud activities.
0.394361322717731 ZeroAccess, also known as the Sirefef botnet, is believed to have infected more than 9 million computers worldwide.

0.4713499441449602 ZeroAccess is a Trojan that employs a rootkit to remain under the radar.
0.4818364111912094 ZeroAccess is also an effective Bitcoin miner as well, allocating at least half of its resources to stealing the digital currency.
0.4325274006805436 ZeroAccess is an example of where the actual initial threat goes undetected, but we see the stuff that gets on after that point," he says.
0.284734766096691 ZeroAccess is financial malware that deals in click-fraud, Bitcoin theft and includes rootkit capabilities that help it avoid detection from security software.
0.497215418313308 ZeroAccess is, however, the biggest peer-to-peer botnet, according to Symantec.
0.3747094055773002 ZeroAccess is likely the biggest offender, a potent malware family with rootkit capabilities that has been folded into a number of exploit kits, including Blackhole one of the most potent commercial kits available on the underground.
0.2233128339415235 ZeroAccess is segmented into two distinct botnets that operate over different UDP ports:
0.551933743313011 ZeroAccess is used to commit a slew of crimes, including search hijacking, which "hijacks".
0.3999137975555996 ZeroAccess malware, sometimes found on peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing sites, was the top infector in the computing public this quarter, up from third place one quarter ago (the DOWNAD/ Conficker worm came a close second).
0.746439609945037 ZeroAccess, or Sirefef as Microsoft likes to call it , is a malware platform that targets all major browsers and search engines.
0.1918790626083137 ZeroAccess (or Sirefef) is a piece of malware that is very adept at hiding its existence from users, and brings in huge sums of money to its masters by performing click-fraud and Bitcoin mining.

0.535848241379959 ZeroAccess's main moneymaking method is click fraud.
0.132166009680727 A new strain of the TDSS malware has been pegged as "the most sophisticated threat" to computer security in the world today by a Kaspersky Labs researcher and is being used to slave more than 4.5 million PCs in a massive botnet that's equipped with an "anti-virus" to prevent other bot-creating viruses from taking it over.
0.1963830957284582 A new version of the TDSS/TDL-4 botnet is rapidly growing, primarily because it's having great success using an evasion technique known as a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to avoid detection, researchers at Damballa Security revealed today..
0.366742112543041 Also, in this update, the developers have updated the rootkit to TDL4 (This making it vulnerable to anti TDSS tools)," Tanya Koyfman and Assaf Keren of the SenseCy blog, run by Israeli company Terrogence, wrote in a blog post on the bot .
0.691306562068074 Analysts from Kaspersky Lab this week published research on a new version of the TDSS malware (a. k. a. TDL), a sophisticated malicious code family that includes a powerful rootkit component that compromises PCs below the operating system level, making it extremely challenging to detect and remove.
0.2504555324472016 Botezatu has been most surprised by the success of the Slammer worm, the virality of Conficker, the way cyber-crooks made easy money with the Rogue AV campaigns and the complexity of the TDSS family.
0.73984522137209 Development has been going on since TDL since 2008 (or perhaps even earlier) and now is on version 4 (TDL-4).
0.386447922149216 Here's some of the code that the TDSS used to perform the above routine: .rsrc: FC5470B0 lea ecx, [ebx+364h]. .rsrc: FC5470B6 push ecx. .rsrc: FC5470B7 push ebx. .rsrc: FC5470B8 sub ebx, 8122F44Bh. .rsrc: FC5470BE add ebx, eax. .rsrc: FC5470C0 add ebx, edi. .rsrc: FC5470C2 push ebx. .rsrc: FC5470C3 push [ebp+arg_0]. .rsrc: FC5470C6 lea eax, [ebp+var_20]. .rsrc: FC5470C9 push eax. .rsrc: FC5470CA push 1. .rsrc: FC5470CC push 2. .rsrc: FC5470CE push 48399F96h. .rsrc: FC5470D3 push [ebp+var_4]. .rsrc: FC5470D6 call get_api. .rsrc: FC5470DB call eax ; {nt!
0.511110747812612 In a blog post published today, Golovanov discusses how TDSS is being used for mining Bitcoins , an electronic currency.
0.703855233364848 In an exhaustive analysis of TDSS published in June, Kaspersky researchers Sergey Golovanov and Igor Soumenkov wrote that among the many components installed by TDSS is a file called "socks.
0.746514157125682 It leverages the cloud to utilize multiple virus databases and I've found it also works for several rootkits such as TDSS and TDL4 that other apps miss.
0.757865287307184 Notable examples include XPAJ and TDSS , but there are many others, including targeted attack campaigns such as The Mask .
0.764303552124753 Researchers say this Firefox add-on helps customers use Internet connections of TDSS-infected PCs.
0.4835147340322578 TDL itself has been around several years, but the new TDSS variant is really sophisticated and comes loaded with anti-virus capabilities to stop the Windows host PC getting infected by other malware or botmasters.
0.777375343369222 TDSS also removes approximately 20 malicious programs from host PCs, preventing systems from communicating with other bot families.
0.532412182517298 TDSS as some of you may recognize is a rootkit that can access Windows at its lowest levels and can prove extremely difficult to remove.
0.509598290560384 "TDSS uses a range of methods to evade signature, heuristic, and proactive detection, and uses encryption to facilitate communication between its bots and the botnet command and control center," security expert Sergey Golovanov writes this week a research note in on the SecureList site.
0.2267008103482208 TDSS, which also is known by a variety of other names, including TDL4 and Alureon, has been infecting machines for about three years now, but this is the first time that researchers have discovered a variant that is accompanied by its own propagation method.
0.05074093633538434 That's because the TDSS-infected systems aren't always turned on: Their legitimate, oblivious owners sometimes turn their PCs off at night and on weekends.
0.364850948021145 The criminals operated under the company name "Rove Digital," and distributed DNS changing viruses, variously known as TDSS, Alureon, TidServ, and TDL4 viruses.
0.1683431098162223 The full release notes for the latest version of Zorenium detail the bot's full functionality, including its banking Trojan capability and its use of the TDL family of rootkits.
0.4187586753997929 The functionality is contained in TDL4, which is the latest version of an older rootkit also known as TDSS.
0.2058815033377808 The latest version of TDSS - dubbed TDL-4 - has already infected 4.5 million PCs ; it uses a custom encryption scheme that makes it difficult for security experts to analyze traffic between hijacked PCs and botnet controllers.
0.3025828342473002 The TDSS malware family functions as rootkits that are able to take complete control of affected systems; in addition their complexity and sophistication makes these malware difficult to remove.
0.409990505005570 The velocity of the cat-and-mouse game continues to increase, unfortunately, and the authors of TDSS seem to have patched it to be compatible with the new MS10-015 patch.
0.1705205855544141 These redirections in turn, increase the number of clicks gathered by TDSS thus creating more profit for its perpetrators.
0.436671612335540 "This 'antivirus' actually helps TDSS; on the one hand, it fights cybercrime competition, while on the other hand it protects TDSS and associated malware against undesirable interactions that could be caused by other malware on the infected machine.".
0.2131718430189741 This can be seen in the large number of detections that we see regularly, as can be seen in the following chart: We've even seen TDSS variants that use high-profile vulnerabilities to spread.

0.0888698691936301 But because of the way Conficker works, everything appears to be fine because the malware is designed to indicate that everything is working normally and software is up to date, he said.
0.514810181827847 In recent (2014) reports Conficker has accounted for nearly 1/3 of the top 10 Internet threats detected, Gorup explains. The largest issue with this malware now is that it disables auto-updates and anti-virus (AV). To the user, all seems to be fine until the dozens of other infectious software take hold of the host. By then, it's too late for the user, as all control of his/her machine is lost to attackers around the world.
0.05032700544755730 One of the largest and most resilient botnets ever seen was created by the notorious Conficker worm that infected over 11 million computers by exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows operating system.
0.403047310867737 A fix for that vulnerability was released by Microsoft 29 days before Conficker first began to appear and if users had applied the patch quickly enough Conficker would have been dead on arrival.
0.4101548024729152 A recent example was the Conficker worm: we developed a generic Figure 1-3: AV Comparatives Awards heuristic update for the worm and used ThreatSense technology to see how many variants of the worm were detected before a new heuristic update would be required.
0.4803452999210 A self-described "cabal" of companies, including Microsoft, Symantec, and a host of domain registration providers, have been trying to thwart the efforts of Conficker by pre-registering and locking up the domain names being used by the worm to distribute updates.
0.2980720190776896 After computers in Germany became infected with the notorious Conficker worm, 170 of them were disposed of and replaced with new equipment at the taxpayers' expense.
0.481846978890476 Although DOWNAD or Conficker emerged as early as 2008, it remains to be a prevalent threat today.
0.0843285847315595 Although the worm era is almost over, Conficker is still kicking using it's self prorogation mechanisms.
0.3237291165394121 An updated version of the Conficker worm is installing malware that attempts to lure people into buying rogue anti-virus software.

0.789208917774450 And yet, it has come to light that after computers at German teacher training institutes in Schwerin, Rostock and Greifswald became infected with the notorious Conficker worm in September 2010, 170 of them were disposed of and replaced with new equipment at the taxpayers' expense.
0.1963074624196694 April 1, 2009, came and went, and with the worm unable to download any updates due to the efforts of the Conficker Working Group, no hard disks drives were erased; no mass mailings of spam or copies of the worm were sent; and no DDoS, espionage or other attacks were seen.
0.1008555684218486 April 1 may not have turned into the D-day that some feared Conficker might create, but the newest version of the worm (Conficker.C) is still out in the wild with mischief on its mind.
0.1730517413735713 April 1st, 2009 On March 4th, 2009 another Conficker variant emerged, which would draw attention to the worm from all technology- focused media.
0.591421481230280 As patches needed to remove Conficker/DOWNAD have been available for more than four years now, its presence indicates widespread failure to follow best practices on software patching, including running security software and updating it.
0.746438481234512 As Sophos' Chester Wisniewski noted the day after the LinkedIn hack last June, SophosLabs determined that all but two of the passwords used by the Conficker worm to spread through Windows networks were used by someone in the 6.5 million user password dump.

0.06092191064817520 Experts have warned that the hole could give rise to a new family of worms such as Conficker .
0.660892557037272 Five years ago, Conficker/DOWNAD was first seen and quickly became notorious due to how quickly it spread and how much damage it caused.
0.786064806080738 Five years ago, the Conficker worm spread like wildfire by exploiting a vulnerability in Windows.
0.599721996231058 For example, the Conficker worm has been active since October 2008, and more than two years later it is still active and frequently tops the rankings determined by ESET Latin America of the most frequently detected malicious programs for each month.
0.470779336080253 German ministry replaced brand new PCs infected with Conficker worm, rather than disinfect them.

0.722360367401557 Greg Rattray, Chief of Internet Security at ICANN, suggested that: "The best way to face threats like Conficker is by the security and domain name systems working together."
0.0697727785557050 Headless and without purpose, the Conficker worm will likely live on for more years, though, as long as computers capable of hosting it are connected to the Internet.
0.752622573173644 However, the more pressing issue is to ask oneself what the community has learned from Conficker's existence.
0.634498355478265 I hope this stays as just Conficker, if there's another large scale breakout we might be in trouble again.
0.490841096570518 I recently attended a presentation about the current state of the Conficker worm, delivered by Felix Leder and Tillman Werner, two German security researchers from the University of Bonn .

0.261786306672445 If an epidemic of this kind does not give users the opportunity to learn how to manage security issues efficiently, this indicates that while today's problem may be Conficker, tomorrow there will certainly be another kind of malware creating similar problems.
0.533437817471254 If nothing else, security firms learned that they can cooperate to fight a threat like Conficker without putting themselves at a competitive disadantage, Nazario said.
0.476300406678655 If you need some help thinking up a very strong password that you can remember, Graham posted some hints on choosing strong passwords when he discussed conficker way back in January.
0.755552269938125 In case you've purged it from your memory, Conficker emerged in late 2008 and made a major splash in the early part of 2009 when researchers discovered that the worm had an update scheduled for April 1.

0.097127323331207 In this edition of the Lab Matters webcast, malware researcher Tillmann Werner and Ryan Naraine discuss the ongoing battle to control the Conficker/Kido botnet and the need for the computer security industry to consider newer approaches to mitigating the botnet epidemic.
0.58388315412466 Indeed, it persists in the top two to three, generally alternating with Autorun exploiting malware and (more recently) Conficker in the top spot.
0.781866928906617 Interestingly, they have not updated the content on these sites to reflect the Conficker infection:
0.1824044352249598 It appears that the once-celebrated and now nearly forgotten Conficker malware has entered that realm.
0.307542307801197 It is generally believed that the main reason for the Conficker worm being such a successful piece of malware is the vast numbers of unpatched Windows PCs.
0.128289762411043 It is one of the recently discovered vulnerabilities in SMB server service and is also being used by malware like Conficker.
0.2818600534850783 It looks like a lot of measures are going into place to limit the damage Conficker can cause and attempting of course to stop it spreading far and wide.
0.266824075592811 It's not clear yet where the folks at Twitter got their list of banned passwords from but it occurred to me that it might be interesting to compare it to another list of common passwords, this time a list that the bad guys are using, the 246 passwords used by Conficker .
0.478441579140399 It's not surprising, then, that India continues to be plagued by DOWNAD/Conficker: many systems have not yet been patched to close the security hole that was exploited.

0.3191948125071334 So if a bot like Conficker appears and it doesn't meet the institution's "trust criteria," it doesn't run.
0.585384553762253 So it seems something big was brewing with Conficker , they just didn't want to do what everyone expected and unleash it on April 1st when all eyes were on them.
0.0630885216268167 Some security experts have speculated that if exploited the hole could spark the beginning of an onslaught of new worms, some perhaps rivaling Conficker .

0.1419141176523053 That said, Nazario believes that the Internet community learned valuable lessons just by gearing up to battle Conficker - and that the coming years bring more progress on international and cross-industry efforts to stamp out subsequent outbreaks.
0.75015213718730 That working group was formed in 2009, yet according to the group's latest statistics , nearly 3 million systems remain infected with Conficker.
0.313497168606323 That's assuming all the Conficker infections are controlled by the same herders (which IMHO is unlikely).
0.0422868518662523 The answer can be summarized by the worldwide statistics of Conficker detection rates drawn from ESET's ThreatSense.
0.4136348256731827 The battle to counter Conficker and the worm author's response to those efforts proved the limits of technical approaches to remediation, said Nazario.
0.4648439130682263 The Conficker element of this case is interesting for several reasons: The worm was so sophisticated and spread so quickly that it prompted unprecedented cooperation among governments and security experts, who formed the Conficker Working Group to help contain the damage wrought by the worm.
0.3095349956156322 The Conficker worm has been a hot topic for months as white hats and black hats have struggled to one-up each other.

0.611492464512220 The human population will eventually grow weary of the endless parade of worldwide hair-on-fire technology problems like Y2K, Conficker, Heartbleed, and, as of this week, Shellshock .
0.763035107260035 The inability to attribute Conficker to an individual or group has been named as a key failure of the effort to combat the worm and eliminate the threat.
0.516134447157462 The lists have only 29 passwords in common with another 100 of the conficker list shorter than Twitter's 6 character limit.
0.686856802499339 The name will be known to anyone familiar with computer viruses - Conficker was possibly the most virulent malware of the 2000s, forming botnets as it went.
0.344317658882439 The numbers associated with Conficker over 12 months of activity are proof of the starring role this worm will have in malware history and of how much it is possible to learn from it.
0.362362160252190 The original flavor and its nastier follow-up (Conficker.A and Conficker.B) have been locked down, but the worm's creators have a third version (Conficker.C, naturally) prepared to hit the tubes come April 1.
0.4550157019937154 The original GeoIP service being accessed had since decommissioned the URL used by Conficker (too much traffic and all nonproductive) and was willing to forward all requests to the University of Bonn, where Tillman and Felix started to serve a one-line version of the GeoIP database, putting all IPs squarely into the Ukraine.
0.676646445184200 The partial decay of the Conficker botnet, paired with antivirus vendors' programs to educate users on how to spot fakes, cut into the rogue AV business.

0.781757675522565 The six-year old Conficker worm is still a major presence in the threat landscape, accounting for 38% of all detections in the first half of 2014, according to security vendor F-Secure's latest Threat Report .
0.2820132149482713 There have been cleaning tools available for Conficker for several years now and the vulnerabilities that the worm exploits have been patched for even longer.
0.690499266468806 This past weekend, SophosLabs noticed a new "Conficker" theme in the content of these spam messages.
0.3852321771365574 This point is particularly relevant right now, given the continuing volumes of Conficker that we're continuing to see.
0.4398643620622586 This was a dangerous development, as the last malware to use DGA download routines was DOWNAD/Conficker.
0.3819792223446897 This was a significant contributing factor to Conficker's success in self-propagation.
0.206241442477293 Though Conficker infections have only turned up on Windows machines, Macintosh security vendor Intego said it is closely monitoring the situation.
0.434052954953016 Trailing behind Conficker in the number two slot were Web-based attacks, which accounted for 20 percent of the top threats and frequently target the U.S., France and Sweden.

0.374234342055737 Unlike the previous Conficker variants which generated 250 random domains.
0.689927091962640 Until then, it's a bit like the dilemma we faced nearly five years ago when the Conficker virus came out and stood poised to do something new on 01 April 2009.
0.491258908532038 Using Conficker/DOWNAD popularized the use of a domain generation algorithm (DGA).
0.2026076666901859 W32/Confick-A (also detected proactively using Behavioural Genotype technology as Mal/Conficker-A ) will be prevented from spreading across the network by our buffer overflow detection technology which detects the worm's attack on a running copy of the SVCHost.exe process and prevents execution of the exploit.
0.2116446608482417 We may already be there, given that six full years after the Conficker worm was announced, we still see about a million unique IP addresses per day in the Conficker sinkhole.
0.2186398341707537 Week in review: Sizing up botnets, Conficker still alive and kicking, and a new exploit kit spotted in the wild.
0.732918159757825 Well, for one, Conficker disables AV solutions installed on the computers, and in general prevents them from being updated with new signatures by blocking them from contacting the AV vendors' websites and servers.
0.796750389975186 While ESET has effective detection for Conficker, it's important for end users to ensure that their systems are updated with the Microsoft patch, which has been available since the end of October, so as to avoid other threats using the same vulnerability.
0.650874186227062 While malware, such as the infamous Conficker worm, has used a variety of anti-VM techniques to attempt to make analysis more difficult, Shylock may be the first to detect whether the VM is actively being controlled by a researcher through a remote connection, according to software security firm Trusteer .
0.527942137154563 With all the hype around Conficker recently, it should come as no surprise that scammers are using this highly publicized threat to attempt to spread more malware.
0.548268502250726 with Gregg Keizer, Conficker's presence on a machine practically guarantees infections by other malware.
0.455065183187344 WORM_DOWNAD, also known as Conficker , is still the No. 1 malware threat this quarter, a full five years after it burst on to the scene, shows that even old threats still have teeth.".
0.4904318317139958 In November 2007, we published an article by Kimmo Kasslin ( F-Secure ) and Elia Florio ( Symantec ), in which they analysed the 'Srizbi'.
0.611505889852588 After further investigations into the kernel payload, we identified it as a new variant of Srizbi, a well-known In addition, starting in April 2014 and within a period of kernel spam bot back in 2008 [1] .
0.429977106192724 After many unsuccessful tries, as a fallback mechanism, Srizbi generated 4 new domain names based on the current date.
0.769401230430413 After months of silence, yesterday we finally found some Srizbi activity in one of our customer's networks.
0.58831688663190 After seeing Srizbi come alive again, the first thing I wanted to do was to grab a Srizbi sample which could communicate with this new CnC on port 80 from my botlab's controlled environment.
0.657702952300438 And now, we see a direct connection between Trojan.Papras and Srizbi.
0.394526422178263 Another reason why we think this spambot deserves a new name (rather than continuing with the Srizbi moniker, that is) is because the malware code has been completely rewritten with more robust features, including now being equipped with a bootkit.
0.4604553947213574 As an update, at last count this afternoon, Srizbi is well over 450,000 Bots, and the number does not appear to be slowing.
0.3525629744002760 As Srizbi and Rustock are (temporarily) shutdown, there are only a few botnets.
0.684911590493520 But according a report released in January 2009 by Trustwave's M86 Security called Xarvester: The New Srizbi , Xarvester (pronounced "harvester") was a pharmacy spam machine tied to SpamIt that emerged at about the same time that Srizbi disappeared, and was very similar in design and operation.

0.090414087246131 FireEye was temporarily able to put out of commission one of the world's largest cyber crime infrastructures (the Srizbi botnet) and that event had an immediate impact on global cyber crime.
0.735985117169430 First, the takedown of cybercriminal hosting hub McColo kneecapped Srizbi for a few weeks because all of its control servers were hosted there.
0.29845092077697 Here is one link I extracted from some Srizbi SPAM emails which shows the type of people who actually pay these guys to promote their businesses.
0.1165691728225880 In previous takedowns, such as those executed against the Srizbi botnet, the botmasters have been able to regain control over their herds of infected PCs using a complex algorithm built into the malware that generates a random but unique Web site domain name that the bots would be instructed to check for new instructions and software updates from its authors.
0.1360938446939897 Lanstein and his colleagues at security firm FireEye reverse engineered a botnet dubbed Srizbi, which used a date-based algorithm to periodically generate new sets of domains from which the botnet's shadowy controllers could issue new orders to their network.
0.04809845959672720 Let me repeat that - Srizbi has 4 hard coded .com domains in it that the author did not register before he put out the binary.
0.740546212692482 Quietly, Srizbi and Rustock have eclipsed Storm in our labs and at our (quicky growing!)
0.3493301412745891 Researchers have already found a connection and various similarities between 'Srizbi' and 'Xarvester'.
0.1165517961056882 Row: A couple things the FE research team has discovered how to command Srizbi to do, but will not be doing for obvious reasons: Sending the "uninstall" command; Sending an updated binary; Sending an updated driver; Attempting to decrypt any of the data being sent to us by these Bots (other than those from our labs)
0.1731123307724444 Row: The Srizbi Bots have some sort of a timeout, in the timeframe of 36 hours and/or around 500 connections, where if they get the wrong response from the server, they will just stop connecting., Interestingly, when we changed the IP of the domain, we get another 36 hours out of them., Because the "timeout" is so short, we don't believe we are having any overlap in the count due to home users being DHCP'd
0.54002596122446 Row: We only registered 192 domains, which represents 4 or 5 times that many Srizbi samples; there are likely more., It's tough to prove a negative, and although we think we have a high percentage of the domains, we'd be more than happy to take more domains if anyone knows of some that are not yet registered
0.737208116386059 Srizbi briefly recovered in Feb. 2009, only to be hammered again by Microsoft, which pushed out an update to its malicious software removal tool that uninstalled Srizbi from Windows PCs.
0.63778582701199 That report was prompted in part by a strange blast of spam sent via Srizbi that promoted the presidential candidacy of Texas Congressman Ron Paul .
0.578839402034098 The result: Srizbi was incapacitated, with the exception of a brief resurrection attempt that ultimately proved futile.
0.661041433988218 The Srizbi botnet was only active for a year or so, but in that time it reached the point where its computers were responsible for 60% of all spam worldwide - 60 billion emails every day, in 2007/08 .
0.770259478706815 The Srizbi botnet would emerge as perhaps the most important casualty of the McColo takedown at the end of 2008.
0.558314121790990 These names show up in an insightful analysis of Srizbi published in 2007 by Joe Stewart , senior security researcher at Atlanta-based SecureWorks .
0.3558849077201623 This claim is probably true; by examining details in the source code, we were able to identify at least one of the principal coders of Reactor 3/Srizbi, a Ukrainian who goes by the nickname "vlaman."
0.798112913895651 This made Google a top dog, but also a primary target of rival botmasters selling software to SpamIt, particularly the hacker known as "SPM," the brains behind the infamous Srizbi botnet.
0.2754309561971033 This means the initial Srizbi SPAM was intended for Russia (or a Russian speaking region), and all SMTP servers that the sample tried to contact ended in .ru.
0.693068850567008 To get another estimate on the size of the botnet, I dug up some data on Srizbi which FireEye was able to hijack and shutdown a year ago.
0.755542681239951 We will also be providing removal instructions and more technical detail about the possible data losses from Srizbi.
0.363505067455690 While going through all the events sequentially I found that Srizbi infected hosts also generated 'Xarvester' like CnC communication.
0.114950842378364 An analysis from the firm looked at three large-scale zero-day attacks affecting Flash Player; one particular zero-day attack instigated using the HanJuan Exploit Kit showed that cyber-criminals paid an average of 75 cents for every 1,000 infected advertising impressions on major websites at highly trafficked times of day.
0.631213361385013 Analysis of one particular zero-day attack instigated using the HanJuan Exploit Kit showed that cybercriminals paid an average of $74 for every 1,000 infected advert impressions on major websites at highly trafficked times of day.
0.720146406046058 As Kafeine , an independent researcher pointed out to me, the attack is much more similar to the Hanjuan Exploit Kit.
0.402418346187324 Days later, the Hanjuan Exploit Kit was also using a Flash zero day , the last to be patched by Adobe, leading researchers at Trustwave to surmise it was the same criminal group behind both.
0.167699201354351 Reported by TrendMicro (2015-02-02) , fixed with Adobe Flash Player 16.0.0.305 , the CVE-2015-0313 has been introduced in Hanjuan Exploit Kit at beginning of december 2014 according to Malwarebytes.
0.528311880140982 Researchers only observed the Hanjuan Exploit Kit taking advantage of a recently patched Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability - CVE-2015-0313.
0.2454412832069070 The attack appears to be the same or similar to the one described by our friends at MalwareBytes - Hanjuan EK's 'March Madness' malvertising campaign .
0.4425900471769056 The lesser known and stealthy Hanjuan Exploit Kit, which for almost two months was using a Flash Player zero-day (CVE-2015-0313) to infect unsuspecting users, has been quite active again during the past couple of weeks.
0.0742897437693830 TrendMicro (2015-02-02) , fixed with Adobe Flash Player 16.0.0.305 , the CVE-2015-0313 has been introduced in Hanjuan Exploit Kit
0.2127634991141603 Back in 2011, a Halloween-themed targeted attack also used a Taidoor downloader, which was encrypted in a "JPG" file.
0.454746563994455 Both of these samples were the newer versions of Taidoor that we previously described here .
0.50147564899514 Figure 6: Initial communication between a PoisonIvy server and client PoisonIvy also makes use of "keep-alive" requests that Figure 8: Taidoor network traffic are 48 bytes long.
0.2889565840603779 Further investigation reveals that this targeted attack is suspected to be connected to Taidoor because it makes use of the same encryption to hide the network traffic.
0.246485748490555 High-profile campaigns like Safe and Taidoor have made use of this vulnerability, and "if anything it's a commonly targeted flaw in sophisticated campaigns," TrendLabs researchers noted in a blog .
0.529578824662788 If you are not interested in exploit, you can use the Taidoor payload plus 18 other Taidoor binaries to develop your own signatures for this trojan or test your AV.
0.718989163913751 It is often seen used in APT campaigns alongside two other infamous RATs - PoisonIvy and Taidoor.
0.536189727671432 \u2022 Taidoor: Active since March 2009, the threat actors behind this campaign used a seemingly harmless document that when opened actually executed a malicious file in the background.23 It also used malicious .
0.290716109471915 Taidoor traffic has been consistent since 2008 and is easily detectable.
0.582356674782848 Thanks to the CVE-2013-3892 vulnerability, Taidoor, a type of malware that was seen compromising victims in Taiwan over the summer surfaced on a Taiwanese government website on Sept. 26.
0.775873688642585 The decrypted content of the blog post is a DLL file - that is in fact the Taidoor malware.
0.1091616159622124 The fact that Taidoor is not off-the-shelf malware that can simply be downloaded or purchased in the cybercrime underground suggests that all of this activity may be connected in some way.
0.425981342398491 The gang behind the Taidoor attacks also traditionally has used Taiwanese IP addresses for its command and control servers and email addresses.
0.551036200562564 The New Taidoor In the past, other APT campaigns have used blog hosting platforms as a mechanism to transmit CnC server information to compromised targets.
0.723111813100655 This EXE is Taidoor and it is configured to beacon to two command and control (CnC) servers: 58.26.15.106 and 81.10.28.171.
0.496160719338124 This threat has evolved over time, and has recently leveraged Yahoo Blogs as a mechanism to drop the Taidoor malware as a "second stage" component.
0.3731040579927138 This time these exploits are being used to deliver Taidoor and PlugX backdoors, according to FireEye.
0.1234095356911070 When decrypted by the "downloader", this text is actually a modified version of the traditional Taidoor malware.
0.605682639027266 Microsoft's botnet enforcement is about the proactive disruption of cybercriminal networks because they create more damage, he explained, sharing some examples of the botnet cases that Microsoft helped bring down, including the world's largest spambot Rustock in 2009 which sent out 30 million spam a day and 2011's Zeus which infected 13 million PCs and caused $100 million worth of losses.
0.4699094462598716 A case might also be made for better legislation-one of the more surprising aspects of Microsoft's Rustock lawsuit was the circuitous route by which the company had the server hardware used by the botnet seized.
0.63924386784979 A new report published by the Composite Block List (CBL), the anti-spam group that gathers data used by Spamhaus, shows that Rustock had been pushing spikes of spam that regularly account for 80% of all spam.
0.526850184122008 A similar result with Rustock will result in long-term disruption of the network.
0.450826423023245 According to Richard Boscovich, senior attorney for Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, the software giant seized the Rustock control servers by securing what's known as an "ex parte temporary restraining order," which allowed Microsoft to take down the botnet without giving the defendants advance notice.
0.1801234793089717 Active Response for Security (MARS) program, which is responsible for taking down both the Rustock botnet
0.282843292685952 All Rustock variants which were able to update themselves during McColo's brief return on 15 Nov 2008, are back with new nasty SPAM campaigns.
0.4463828125116320 Based on my own experience, I can say with confidence that shutting down Harnig can't be as easy as we saw in case of Rustock where almost all of the C&Cs were located within USA.
0.1043060964676818 Because Rustock sent as much as half of all the spam, any decline in its activity produces noticeable results.
0.734341382139193 BMW 530xi. In March, I published a story linking the Rustock botnet to a spammer who used the nickname Cosma2k .
0.3687596861664914 But it's starting to become a slightly dicier occupation these days, as evidenced by the news of the takedown of the venerable and virulent Rustock botnet by researchers at Microsoft and FireEye.
0.0422753965818414 But now that the Rustock network has been kneecapped by researchers and law enforcement, that's no longer happening.
0.729325801917101 But since Christmas Day, the Rustock botnet has basically disappeared, as the amount of junk messages from it has fallen below 0.5 percent of all spam, according to researchers at Symantec 's anti-spam unit MessageLabs.
0.321974654758781 By referring this case to the FBI, as we did in September 2011 with our case against the operators of the Rustock botnet, we are affirming our commitment to coordinating our efforts with law enforcement.
0.2326939569850522 By the way, here are some of the more recent email subjects used by the Rustock running in my sandnet:
0.680560199769812 com data acquired in August of last year and information from a Web hosting reseller in Eastern Europe who admittedly rented out servers to an apparent Rustock operator, Krebs managed to draw similar connections between "Cosma2k," a spammit.
0.615002039842158 Due to Rustock's new CnC location architecture, we don't believe that something like McColo will ever exist again.
0.2090606561452488 Due to Rustock's use as a spam generator, the main thing that the command and control servers disseminated was spam templates.
0.786737370374222 Earlier in my Pharma Wars series, I detailed the activities of Cosma - the top SpamIt affiliate who appears to have been responsible for a botnet that competed directly with SPM's - Rustock ..
0.662885571217320 Earlier this month, Microsoft crippled Rustock by convincing a court to let it seize dozens of Rustock control servers that were scattered among several U.S.-based hosting providers.
0.238662058507351 Existing anti-spam legislation only allows domain names to be taken-an insufficient tool for taking down Rustock.
0.567471029527749 First and foremost, Rustock was designed as a rootkit, burying its files and activity deep inside the Windows operating system where it can hide from popular anti- malware products and remain on an infected system longer.".
0.266282542964059 For example, we observed 39 Rustock's CnCs alive and responding within just the past 24 hours.
0.277965297982847 From the CBL report: "At 14:45 GMT on March 16, Rustock appears to have been 'caught' just at the beginning of one of these spikes, and abruptly and precipitously fell to essentially zero output.
0.61458814507626 Global spam volumes fell by one-third following the takedown of the Rustock botnet.
0.626480689954062 Harnig is one of the small pilot fish that lived in the shadow of the Rustock botnet, often downloading the Rustock bot onto compromised machines as part of its own infection routine.
0.574596207318025 Hay said individual bots infected with the Rustock malware were still phoning home to the Rustock control servers, which appeared to be responding with instructions to download files.
0.4634615440227166 Here are the number of active Rustock CnCs observed during each of the last 5 months.
0.658047598740916 His victories included Mega-D and Rustock, which at their height were among the Internet's biggest sources of junk messages.
0.593032348551054 However, some of the components of the malware machine driven by Rustock are beginning to come back online now.
0.0880241927427721 I reported back in March (right after the Rustock botnet shutdown) that Harnig botnet has abandoned all of its CnCs as well causing suspension of all of its malicious activities.
0.598089680231752 If Cosma2k really is responsible for Rustock, the payment data suggests either that he was sharing control over the botnet with others, or that he split his promotion activities across multiple accounts, perhaps to keep legions of other affiliates from feeling resentful of his earnings and to avoid calling undue attention to any one account.
0.418256510573561 In a follow-up post , I wrote that the Rustock botmaster's personal email account was tied to a domain name ger-mes.ru , which at one time featured a résumé of a young man named Dmitri A. Sergeev ..
0.431520605119263 In a widescale operation involving Microsoft, industry partners, academics and law enforcement agencies, the Rustock botnet was shut down on Thursday.
0.4878456742819230 In April, Microsoft launched an apparently successful sneak attack against Rustock , a botnet once responsible for sending 40 percent of all junk email.
0.468817586935258 In early March the U.S. was the second most common source of spam on the Web, now, in the wake of Rustock, the U.S. ranks 15th.
0.63959043486888 In July 2011, Microsoft began offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual(s) responsible for Rustock..
0.352908591342362 In March the company and researchers from FireEye took down the Rustock botnet , which was a much larger and more disruptive network than Kelihos.
0.773219997625601 In Rustock, bots that detected they were no longer being commanded used an algorithm to automatically generate new domains that could then be registered by the botnet controller.
0.1184824499480109 "In short, since the time of the initial takedown, we estimate the Rustock botnet is now less than half the size it was when we took it down in March.
0.220427096009099 In the case of Rustock, Boscovich said two years should be enough time to clean the vast majority of zombie computers.
0.3777747547095574 It looks like the Rustock take down unexpectedly killed two birds with one stone.
0.798848352454833 It was through the combined effort of Microsoft, the judicial system and the industry that Rustock was successfully taken down.".
0.2044996577411839 It's sure to be temporary, but we should enjoy it while we can: Microsoft's action to behead the Rustock botnet has seen global spam levels drop by about a third, according to Symantec-owned messaging and security provider MessageLabs.
0.670291526732841 Keeping in view the timing of this sudden shutdown and Harnig's obvious relationship with Rustock, it can't be a coincidence,
0.110096301557302 Leonard said that the spam subjects are nothing new, basically the same e-card and scam messages that users have been seeing for years: Rustock has been one of the top spam botnets in operation for a while now, but the volume of spam put out by the network began to fall off in the fourth quarter of 2010.
0.1236575545395677 M86 says the decrease in spam is due to a rapid drop in activity from the Rustock botnet (see graphic below left), a collection of spam-spewing zombie PCs that experts say is responsible for relaying about 40 percent of all junk e-mail on any given day.
0.572975518173602 Microsoft actively and even aggressively takes on the largest botnets, and with the help of industry partners and law enforcement agencies, it has dismantled a number of them over the last several years - Rustock, Kelihos, Citadel, to name just a few.
0.648774256345175 Microsoft has fingered a possible author of the late Rustock spam botnet - a self-described software engineer and mathematician who aspired to one day be hired by Google.
0.1026059572971266 Microsoft has released a special version of its Security Intelligence Report that covers the Rustock activity since the takedown in March.
0.131940482185165 Microsoft helped to dismantle Rustock in March after a coordinated and well-timed "stun" targeting the spam botnet's infrastructure, which was mainly comprised of servers based in U.S. hosting facilities.
0.4381366234559247 Microsoft is being careful not to implicate the raided hosting firms in Rustock's spamming operation, according to Krebs's report.
0.312634967014297 Microsoft is to offer a bounty of $250,000 (£155,000) for information that results in the identification, arrest and criminal conviction of those responsible for controlling the Rustock botnet.
0.3277260254152406 Microsoft says it has concluded its civil case against the Rustock botnet operators and referred evidence to the FBI.
0.722593985874873 Microsoft's Digital Crime Unit reported that its "research shows there may be close to one million computers infected with Rustock malware, all under the control of the person or people operating the network like a remote army, usually without the computer's owner even aware that his computer has been hijacked.
0.575456137954716 More than half of Rustock-infected machines have been cleaned since Microsoft led a joint effort earlier this year to shut down the prolific botnet.
0.32576780376389 most likely explanation is that the person(s) operating Rustock rented the botnet to a number of spamit. com affiliates, and many of those affiliates have not yet switched over to another pharmacy spamming affiliate program
0.3606391867020053 Most notably, the takedown of the Rustock botnet earlier this year was a major blow to spammers who relied on the network to hose down the Internet with junk mail for a long time.
0.4316228054477415 Much more prevalent were Rustock botnet infections, which made up 21% of all the ROS issues in Q3.
0.2102881704037722 My own follow-the-money sleuthing on the individual who paid for the hosting that supported the Rustock control servers traced back to a very specific person - a Russian man that Microsoft later named in its public filings with the court.
0.759466882030534 No one was really going after it but it looks like the Harnig and Rustock operators must have been very close to each other such that a hit on Rustock panicked the Harnig bot herders and they felt that they better go underground for a while.
0.666108897176124 "Now, our long term objective is to notify ISPs and get them to help clean the infected systems - not only of Rustock but a host of other bad things on them.".
0.04519323718246881 On Aug. 5, Microsoft filed an update (PDF) to its legal case to unearth the identity of the Rustock botnet author.

0.757009229873098 Rustock is not the only botnet which suffered from the recent take down by Microsoft.
0.333219703957223 Rustock is one of the older botnets that was still in operation, having first emerged about five years ago.
0.4759408727079733 Rustock was responsible for sending 30 billion spam e-mails a day, and thus its takedown alone can't account for the entire drop in spam volume.
0.3022550740565490 Rustock where almost all of the C&Cs were located within USA
0.765354011430643 Rustock's demise resulted in declines in U.S., Israel, and the U.K. most dramatically with 74, 66, and 54 percent declines in spam observed in those countries respectively, IBM reported.
0.1621300803179955 Shergin's n ame was connected with an online payment account that was used to rent Rustock control servers, Krebs said.
0.1171250867361898 Since then, the company has continued to monitor the activity of the network and the machines infected with the Rustock-related malware and found that the botnet is now less than half the size that it was before the takedown.
0.3926324549001979 Symbian and Android the most popular mobile malware environments; Spam dips due to Rustock takedown SANTA CLARA, Calif., McAfee today released the McAfee Threats Report First Quarter 2011.
0.709696898851807 That drop was temporary, but the more lasting effect of the Rustock takedown was the disinfection of a huge number of the PCs that previously had been part of the botnet.
0.661275608171755 The company had to use trademark law-claiming that Rustock's spam infringed on both its own and Pfizer's trademarks-in order to have the server hardware seized.
0.559928185230099 The company's experts estimated that there are roughly one million PCs infected by the Rustock bot, and the reality is that as long as there is a crew behind Rustock that's interested in making money, the botnet will have a good chance of returning in some form.
0.0750152908146987 The data shows that Rustock's curators made millions by pimping rogue Internet pharmacies, but also highlights the challenges that investigators still face in tracking down those responsible for building and profiting from this complex crime machine.

0.3269043628384309 The takedown occurred on Wednesday, as U.S. Marshals went into several hosting providers' data centers and seized the command and control servers that ran the Rustock network.
0.641361897184319 There are several possible causes for this decline, including the following: The activity of the Rustock spam-sending botnet has recently declined.
0.635209567532834 There must be a medium, a vehicle if you may, to get a Zeus, a Rogue AV, a Rustock (not anymore :)) or any new malware onto a box.
0.2519210072214277 This McColo hosted C&C server, with an IP of 208.66.194.22, was again fully responding to Rustock.
0.601228585189756 This was the Rustock's initial communication just recorded a few minutes ago:
0.759657864263362 Though botnets are multipurpose, it's spam for which Rustock was best known.
0.4151159916321379 Threatpost reported last week that the vast majority of Rustock's 100 plus command and control servers were based out of legitimate data centers in the U.S. In a blog post Monday, Krebs provides a boots on the ground account of the raid on Wholesale Internet, a U.S. hosting company that unwittingly ran Rustock command and control servers.
0.1567671278137808 Thus we should expect spam volumes to increase again soon (Rustock is estimated to be capable of sending 30 billion spams per day), though how big an increase we'll see depends largely on the number of zombie PCs the botnet's controller was able to reach during McColo's temporary resurrection.
0.289689832597643 To be confident that the bot could not be quickly shifted to new infrastructure, we sought and obtained a court order allowing us to work with the U.S. Marshals Service to physically capture evidence onsite and, in some cases, take the affected servers from hosting providers for analysis," Richard Boscovich, senior attorney in Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, said in a blog post on the Rustock takedown.
0.1439392516296010 Two weeks after that takedown, I tracked down a Web hosting reseller in Eastern Europe who acknowledged renting some of those servers to the apparent Rustock author.
0.357308057902462 Update, Mar. 18, 10:04 a. m. ET: As many readers have pointed out, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the takedown of Rustock was engineered by Microsoft, which used the legal process to shutter the botnet's control networks at various U.S.-based hosting providers.
0.64240239147180 Update, March 17, 1:47 p. m., ET: Add the graphic from M86 Security labs, which said on its blog that it also has seen a Rustock spam dry up, and that the botnet's controllers are not responding.
0.763399338233828 Very rarely will one see Rustock using some other infection vector or pay per install network to propagate itself.
0.130717981796375 Waldac and Rustock have returned to churn out spam according to Symantec while Websense saw it jump in a big way over the weekend.
0.2334318777879279 We believe that the Rustock controllers don't expect McColo to be very stable in the near future, so they are hedging their bets and moving the C&C's to a different provider.
0.541182960065576 We don't have many Rustock domains registered, so we've only seen around 1,000 Bots connect to us over the last 24 hours.
0.0412579770386550 Weeks earlier, Microsoft had convinced a federal judge (PDF) to let the software giant seize control of server hard drives and reroute Internet addresses as part of a carefully timed takedown of the Rustock botnet, which had long reigned as the world's most active spam-spewing crime machine.
0.51348004988477 While Kelihos was not as sophisticated as the much larger Rustock botnet taken down in March , it still had methods to resist takedown attempts.
0.638283895570456 While the exact cause of the drop hasn't been proven, Symantec said coordinated take-downs of large botnets including Rustock.
0.494969868710536 Why Harnig has abandoned its old friend Rustock in its time of need is up for debate, but the most likely reason is that there has been a tremendous amount of attention focused on Rustock in the last six months, from the media, researchers and law enforcement.
0.616751607318666 It seems plausible, therefore, to believe that Janicab was created to spy on others, something that has become increasingly common with malware in recent years.
0.1035936589691718 The final point of interest about Janicab is, of course, why was it written?
0.732421984209200 The final point of interest about Janicab is, of course, why was it written?
0.531697577419365 We have seen a low number of ITW variations on exploitation of this vulnerability as a malformed TIFF file, all dropping backdoors like Citadel, the BlackEnergy bot, PlugX, Taidoor, Janicab, Solar, and Hannover.
0.528591640652698 We've been seeing a resurgence of the RLO trick as of late in malware samples, namely a signed piece of Mac malware named ' Janicab ' which was documented by F-secure.
0.342846766366755 While the Janicab activity dates the use of CVE-2013-3906 to July, other groups, including those associated with advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, have now begun to use this exploit as well.
0.120543457747299 XProtect remains painfully ineffective against malware, even Janicab that has been around since June.
0.284415780532070 The command and control server appears to be offline so DeathRing no longer poses an immediate threat to users with infected handsets, says Jeremy Linden, a security researcher at Lookout.
0.3213720330040620 The DeathRing malware is loaded in the system directory of several devices mostly from third-tier handset manufacturers, which include:
0.386845201277 The DeathRing malware will activate if the phone is powered down and rebooted five times.
0.1827822949008599 The number of Pre-loaded mobile trojan in the wild is increasing, DeathRing is the last one discovered by the experts at Lookout firm.
0.647298849363106 This month, the mobile security vendor Lookout Research warned of "DeathRing" a mobile Trojan that it found pre-installed on several Android smartphones sold in Asia and Africa by second- and third-tier manufacturers.
0.2079467137290206 A significant bulk of these malware, specifically 63%, is WORM_GAMARUE variants.
0.63405974834893 By contrast, people using unpatched software were exposed to malicious payloads that installed the Dorkbot and Gamarue trojans, as well as malware that turned visitors' machines into Bitcoin miners.
0.727737961528390 In our monitoring of the GAMARUE malware family, we found a variant that used the online code repository SourceForge to host malicious files.
0.0483666793806470 Just months after my report, we are still seeing notable activities from the said botnet, in particular a sudden boost of GAMARUE variants last week.
0.3874821245037858 The attachment ZIP file contains an executable of an Andromeda bot loader or also known as the Gamarue Trojan.
0.672736928060235 The first half of the year 2013 is shaping up to be a year of rehash , with dated threats like ZBOT, CARBERP , and GAMARUE using new techniques to evade detection or at least stealthier ways to slip into user's system unnoticed.
0.0734268660974762 This third file (detected as TROJ_GAMARUE.RMA) decrypts the main GAMARUE file, which has been disguised as a thumbs.db file.
0.4490767086602992 We also have found ties with different malware campaigns, from ZeuS to a recent newcomer to the malware scene called Gamarue.
0.236563374994817 After the mobile threat ends up on a user's smartphone, cybercriminals then use the computer-based Trojans to gain access to the victim's bank account, and Faketoken allows them to harvest mTANs and transfer the victim's money to their accounts.
0.3755224827318357 Crooks are also looking to hijack mobile banking transactions with FAKEBANK and FAKETOKEN malware variants.
0.1936772245977018 Faketoken is a banking Trojan that entered Kaspersky Lab's Top 20 most frequently detected threats by the end of the quarter.
0.1649328400883428 Figure 18: Attacks involving Faketoken, compared to all attacks involving mobile banking Trojans from August 2013 to July 2014.
0.613752074264895 Mobile banking Trojans have usually pretended to be security applications (for example, Zitmo) or legitimate banking apps ( FakeToken or FkSite a.k.a. Perkele) to trick users into installing the malware.
0.549734461941389 On the other hand, this new threat shows that Android malware targeting financial transactions have evolved from a joint PC-mobile attack (like Zitmo and Spitmo ), phishing attacks via apps (like FakeToken ), and SMS messages using only an URL to a unified threat that replaces legitimate banking apps with a malicious application to obtain several authentication factors.
0.647429670774053 The Faketoken mobile banking trojan, for example, has affected users in 55 countries, including Germany, Sweden, France, Italy, the UK and the US.
0.549575197204943 Two banking Trojans, Faketoken and Svpeng , are vivid examples of such attempts at globalization.
0.392260081148660 While Cryptolocker used the GameOver ZeuS botnet, the Onion Ransomware uses the Andromeda botnet, and while the former used the RSA/AES encryption, the latter uses the ECDH algorithm.
0.2038382236538858 In igfxtray.exe I found the trace of sqlite commony used by Andromeda Botnet:
0.79903224206462 Just recently, however, I uncovered that there is an ongoing development in the Andromeda botnet.
0.4825747941940594 Kaspersky has uncovered that for the Onion malware to reach a device, it first goes via the Andromeda botnet.
0.05952986562718920 The 1Q of the year proved this thesis, as seen in threats like CARBERP and Andromeda botnet .

0.05368529048783210 "Chthonic uses the same encryptor as Andromeda bots, the same encryption scheme as Zeus AES and Zeus V2 Trojans, and a virtual machine similar to that used in ZeusVM and KINS malware.".
0.604458291124248 For example, ransomware known as "Critoni," "CTB-Locker" as well as "Onion," which was discovered in June by the malware researcher Kafeine , is being distributed by the Andromeda bot, which first infects PCs with an e-mail worm called Joleee that's designed to send spam e-mails and download further attack code.
0.680829083110609 Waledac was not a high threat, it's less than 1% of the spam traffic, Cox said. What we're worried about is Zeus, which is a far more damaging botnet, which is creating a substantial amount of spam.

0.518293672696882 Finally we have the newcomers: Darkmailer, Waledac, Slenfbot, and Kelihos:
0.08800888657228 I asked Boscovich how this operation was different from previous actions against botnets such as Rustock and Waledac .
0.439706249327125 In a Friday post , Symantec warns that the Kelihos botnet is being used to send phishing emails purporting to be from Apple.
0.623810596378345 In an analysis of Virut botnet samples, Symantec researchers observed the malware downloading Waledac variants, suggesting that the gangs responsible for each botnet may be cooperating with one another through some sort of affiliate program, or, at the very least, that the two threats coexist and function on single infected machines.
0.672301304317164 In late September, researchers from Kaspersky and Microsoft worked together on a coordinated takedown of the Kelihos botnet , which involved a common technique known as sinkholing.
0.612461136987307 Instead, each field now corresponds to 1-2 character name," Maria Garnaeva, a Kaspersky Lab analyst, wrote in a new analysis of the reformed Kelihos botnet.
0.526594959303762 Kelihos, which is sometimes grouped in with the more well-known Waledac botnet, is a fairly small botnet, at an estimated 41,000 machines, but Microsoft officials said that the network was being used for a large variety of activities, including child pornography.
0.355109920133741 Less than a month after the botnet's shutdown Microsoft has dropped the suit against the Kelihos botnet domain provider.
0.1234736438904242 Let's start with some technical background: Kelihos is Microsoft's name for what Kaspersky calls Hlux.
0.737065046745640 Like previous Storm/WALEDAC variants, WORM_KELIHOS.SM communicates via a peer-to-peer (P2P) mechanism.
0.2115583493504247 Microsoft specifically has been quite aggressive in going after botnets in the last six months or so, initiating takedowns of the Rustock and Waledac botnets.
0.2733747616660433 Moreover, the Kelihos botnet came off the bench when the attackers re-gained access of the sinkholed bots through the Facebook worm, as well as expanding to newly infected machines and actively sending spam.

0.329336844014706 The criminal gang behind the last wave of attacks are tricking victims proposing a software by pretending it was designed to attack online resources belonging to US and Western governments, instead it is the Hlux data stealing trojan used to recruit new machine for the malicious Kelihos botnet .
0.666640781865269 The result is that while efforts such as Microsoft's disruption of the Waledac and Rustock botnets were successful, they were far from perfect.
0.406722351348601 The software maker took particular offense to Kelihos because it bore a strong resemblance to Waledac, another spam botnet that Microsoft disabled in early 2010.
0.4885759138803764 The Zeus case is not isolated, recently Kaspersky Lab, in collaboration with CrowdStrike Intelligence Team, Dell SecureWorks and members of the Honeynet Project, dismantled the second Hlux botnet (aka Kelihos)..

0.764294137369802 They claim that the 'resurfaced' Kelihos , or Hlux as they call it, is an altogether new botnet, and its emergence was not unexpected.
0.3501017237669923 This botnet had scary size, it has been estimated it was three times larger than the first botnet Hlux / Kelihos dismantled in September 2011.
0.26149273357029 This may bring back questions about the identity and the origin of the Kelihos botnet and recent trends of collaboration between cybercriminal groups.

0.405305457245436 The result is that while efforts such as Microsoft's disruption of the Waledac and Rustock botnets were successful, they were far from perfect.
0.3690979206354204 The software maker took particular offense to Kelihos because it bore a strong resemblance to Waledac, another spam botnet that Microsoft disabled in early 2010.
0.514819355337852 There's no evidence that control of Kelihos, which also went by the name Hlux, has returned to the control of its creators, the companies said.
0.456834860274238 They also found that, in the case of the latest Kelihos/Hlux botnet, 84 percent of infected machines were running Windows XP.
0.392695778888382 They claim that the 'resurfaced' Kelihos , or Hlux as they call it, is an altogether new botnet, and its emergence was not unexpected.
0.0418492177019880 This botnet had scary size, it has been estimated it was three times larger than the first botnet Hlux / Kelihos dismantled in September 2011.

0.1656523834201916 This may bring back questions about the identity and the origin of the Kelihos botnet and recent trends of collaboration between cybercriminal groups.
0.524087866613844 This may not be the first time Virut has been used to spread the Waledac worm, whose goal is to earn money for its purveyors through rogue ad networks, online pharmacies, or outright fraud.
0.558092267597025 Though Waledac was defeated by seizure of domain names, a different course of action was needed for Rustock.
0.3270724022847041 "We confirm that a new Hlux/Kelihos sample exists but it has a different configuration," Preuss explained via email, "which means it's coming from a new Hlux botnet (Hlux C).
0.4832080759631931 When Kaspersky took down the first Hlux/Kelihos botnet last year, the company explained that in peer-to-peer botnets, each bot keeps up to 500 peer records in a local peer list stored in the Windows registry, and this list is updated with peer information received from other bots.
0.647759609643761 While the first Kelihos botnet (also known as "Hlux") was taken down last September , an entirely new botnet using the same code was identified earlier this year .
0.707721213738923 While this time around Kelihos (a.k.a. Hlux) first caught notice via the "Nap" function , in which it employs extended sleep calls to evade automated analysis systems capturing its behavior, this is just one of the new aspects of the rebooted bot.
0.575309828309368 SIMDA, which functions in a similar method to the previously seen NIMDA (admin spelled backwards) botnet, is unique in its immense span and its deliberate control of host files.
0.72624128204350 There are speculations for why this was done: maybe the SIMDA team was large enough to handle this many bots, maybe they were just showing off or maybe they were selling many of these off as rent-a-bots.
0.1834643254389911 They have also taken a proactive step to prevent further SIMDA spreading by offering links to its collaborators' virus scanning services.

0.4506182665430077 11 Arbor Security Report: ASERT Threat Intelligence Brief 2014-3 Infection Map The following map geographically identifies Dexter and Project Hook infections as of January 27th, 2014.
0.2667581391758181 A Monday TrendLabs blog post noted that despite its use of Tor a la Chewbacca, the names in the LusyPOS code mirror those found in Dexter's "very distinctive text string.".
0.1017836646889879 A report ( PDF ) detailing the campaign, called "Dexter and Project Hook Break the Bank," also revealed additional findings about the malware.
0.628483925360073 According to Arbor's Threat Intelligence Brief 2014-3 released yesterday, researchers noticed a specific variation of Dexter, Dexter Revelation, exfiltrating stolen data, stored in fake .zip files and .txt files - via FTP credentials - from compromised terminals.
0.71321047989915 According to security experts at McAfee vSkimemr is circulating in the underground forums since February and it could an ongoing project, vSkimmer is very complex but despite it appears more sophisticated of Dexter it is easier to use.
0.1530306478598911 According to the company, the targeted POS systems were infected with a variant of Dexter , called "Stardust.".
0.1926829983815889 According to the researchers, Dexter is custom-made malware that steals the process list from the infected machines, while simultaneously parsing memory dumps of specific POS software related processes in search for Track 1/Track 2 credit card data.
0.2189362489450995 Additional methods include Shellshock as well as POS malware such as BlackPOS, Dexter, vSkimmer, Alina and Citadel.
0.259713711660998 After further examination, it appears "It's possible that LusyPOS may be a new Dexter variant that has copied the TOR behavior of the newer POS malware family," the blog said, noting that given Dexter's proven threat, "LusyPOS "is a significant addition" to the "repertoire" of POS threats.
0.549373933545636 Al Pascual , a senior fraud analyst specializing in security and fraud for consultancy Javelin Strategy & Research, says Nemanja is similar to other POS malware strains such as Dexter and BlackPOS .
0.0411840489259599 Along with the Shellshock vulnerability that targets retailers' servers, the security researchers found that POS malware like Alina, BlackPOS, Citadel, Dexter and vSkimmer remain in play.
0.764885695748030 Arbor Networks also disclosed in early December a campaign against retail networks using Dexter and its recent variants of Stardust, Millenium and Revelation.
0.2149937002438481 Arbor Security Report: ASERT Threat Intelligence Brief 2014-3 PoS Malware Activity: Dexter and Project Hook While Arbor ASERT is currently tracking Dexter, Project Hook, Alina, Chewbacca, Vskimmer and JackPoS, this document shall focus on Dexter and Project Hook.
0.405764078499097 At least three distinct versions of the Dexter point of sale (POS) malware are making the rounds this holiday season, designed to steal credit and debit card data from unwitting shoppers.
0.618790635698998 At the end of 2012, the Israel-based company Seculert announced that it had detected a new malware called Dexter , used for parsing memory dumps of specific POS software-related processes looking for Track 1/Track 2 credit card data.
0.670218751249886 Banks in South Africa have suffered tens of millions in losses in rand due to a variant of the Dexter virus, a piece of malware targeting point-of-sale devices.
0.258999641920603 But we have seen a recent surge in malware that specifically targets these systems (e.g. Chewbacca , Dexter , BlackPOS and JackPOS ).
0.645441288672221 Considering the recognized threat that Dexter poses, this is a significant addition to the repertoire of existing PoS threats.
0.312603795496234 Credit card dumps are stolen with the use of skimming hardware, or by infecting POS terminals with special Trojans (Dexter, BlackPOS, JackPOS, BrutPOS, Alina, etc.).
0.1419186686218393 Dexter , a custom point-of-sale (POS) malware, has the ability to search through the memory of POS systems for credit and debit card information.
0.618833222878679 Dexter, as the malware is called, has infected hundreds of point-of-sale computers at big-name retailers, hotels, restaurants, and other businesses, according to a report issued by Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of Israel-based security firm Seculert.
0.4118457591936832 Dexter, for example, parses memory dumps of specific POS software related processes looking for Track 1 and Track 2 data.
0.508348382735033 Dexter is not only able to parse the memory pages for credit/debit card information, but can also capture the manual entry of credit/debit card information.
0.4320378954769432 Dexter is responsible for the loss of nearly 80,000 credit card records and data breach of payment card data of Subway restaurants in 2012.
0.573756828161193 Dexter variants that target English speaking countries, and others which target European
0.484988966234756 Dexter was a doozy, but recent Seculert research reveals that it wasn't the source of the point-of-sale (PoS) attack on Target.
0.1353165993071935 Dexter will continue parsing the data on the next page of the current process, then move on to the next running process in the list.
0.2115641020778238 Dexter's search algorithm is built according to the ISO/IEC standards and takes advantage of the following separators: \u2022 '^', for Track 1 \u2022 '=' or 'D', for Track 2 \u2022 the End Sentinel '?', for both Track 1 and Track 2.
0.2228567569117293 Exactly as its predecessor Dexter, vSkimmer is completely undetectable on the compromised host.
0.3980816025486587 For example, the following strings are known to be HTTP POST variables used by Dexter:
0.1180764808529007 he explained, "It is absolutely full of options to extract tracks from RAM, as RAM-scraping malware [such as Dexter, Alina and BlackPOS] do, but it is very portable and small, and script-based.
0.0757086893637265 In a new article published by SC Magazine , Seculert's CTO Aviv Raff was asked to comment on a new variant of the notorious Dexter malware, which is responsible for malware attacks targeted at point-of-sale (POS) devices in South African fast food restaurants - and, ultimately, for stealing millions of dollars (US)-and counting- from the country's banks.
0.1510591691408249 In a Tuesday blog post, researchers on Arbor Networks' security engineering and response team (ASERT), revealed that two servers hosting Dexter, and other POS malware , called Project Hook, were discovered early last month.
0.508487116618936 It's a major revision of Dexter, a previously discovered piece of malware targeting PoS devices that has already been fingered in other real-world payment card swindles .
0.0905991708230183 It's possible that LusyPOS may be a new Dexter variant that has copied the TOR behavior of the newer PoS malware family.
0.1132115550628309 Malware like Dexter and Project Hook are used by cybercriminals to infect computers hosting PoS software and capture data from each payment operation, the malicious software is used to substitute phisical skimmer usually adopted by criminals.
0.0626044703839840 Of the Dexter and Project Hook infections, Dexter malware appeared to be most active on compromised systems, the ASERT team found.
0.3477259143760935 Other point-of-sale malware families used by the criminals gangs worldwide were Blackpos , Dexter and ChewBacca .
0.3533576162756758 Point of Sale Malware Overview Certain malware, such as Dexter, Project Hook, Alina, ChewBacca, JackPoS and VSkimmer have been written specifically to compromise Point of Sale machines.
0.403338826586157 Researchers still don't know precisely how Microsoft Windows-based terminals are infected by Dexter.
0.4077654131998118 Seculert's Research Lab ran the sample of the malware and discovered that unlike Dexter, this attack had 2 stages, which is a well known attribute of an advanced threat.
0.559135239777753 Security experts at Arbor Networks have found a couple of servers used to arrange a malicous campaign against PoS with Dexter malware.
0.498143151332919 Security issues involving point-of-sale (POS) malware and Dexter, which affects Windows-based systems, continue to plague merchants.
0.2182131441287551 Similarly, the following are commands that are known to be processed by Dexter:
0.561349147220743 "Soraya has clearly taken inspiration from the Dexter and the Zeus families.
0.673266931037369 Systems infected by Dexter are various in our case (gas stations, pawn shops, logistics, luxury shops, doctors, clinics, pharma, labs, etc...)
0.3176149539121514 The case is not isolated, Dexter is responsible for the loss of nearly 80,000 credit card records and data breach of payment card data of Subway restaurants in 2012 meanwhile several days ago, Group-IB has found a new type of POS malware, "DUMP MEMORY GRABBER by Ree [ 4]", written on pure C++ without use of any additional libraries.
0.712248718663764 The Dexter point-of-sale malware is still active in Russia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, but it is not the unique malware designed to menace the world of payment, early 2013 Group-IB detected a new POS malware " DUMP MEMORY GRABBER " a few months after the detection of similar agents like vSkymmer and Project Hook.
0.256578273184987 The good news is that Dexter is easy to deal with: host security measures are ideally suited to detect Dexter at the early stages of an infection or even pre-infection.
0.512965725391298 The information suggests that this new LusyPOS malware family is more closely related to Dexter than Chewbacca.
0.551408095211741 The same new attack techniques being used with banking Trojans also are being applied to many of the malware strains, such as Dexter and BlackPOS , that are targeting retailers, Maor says.
0.1312395305814625 "The unique side of our case is that it is a real botnet with C&C functions, which is active close to half a year and controlled by a group of criminals which has a new type of Dexter," IntelCrawler CEO Andrey Komarov wrote in an e-mail. "The infected PoS merchants are installed in different places and cities... which makes it different as the bad actors infected them separately and then organized a botnet from it."
0.345053866082091 The way LusyPOS incorporates information about the C&C servers and the list of processes the malware is set to check for financial information, and the way it uses registry keys to attain persistence on the machine is similar to that used by Dexter .
0.402356200185761 There are other malware families for POS like JacksPos or Dexter, which could be the responsible ones for big attacks on Target (40 million cards' data stolen) or Home Depot where 56 million cards were leaked after more than 5 months of the attack that started in April and was not discovered until almost September, when the company announces the leak.
0.594529644571223 There are several attack methodologies at play and many forms of new malware, including Dexter, Project Hook, Alina, BlackPoS/Kartoxa, JackPoS, VSkimmer and others.
0.553942428159656 Threat actors worldwide are no doubt emboldened by the success of Dexter , as well as the high-profile attacks at Target , Neiman Marcus , and elsewhere - not to mention all of the ongoing campaigns that we don't yet know about, but will come to light in the weeks and months ahead as consumers get their credit card bills and review their bank statements.
0.2440327453682247 Through his research on Dexter, Wilson discovered what appeared to be a mom-and-pop retailer running multiple applications on a single computer system alongside its POS software, including those for video surveillance and employee time-clock access.
0.358009995984229 Unlike the famous malware family, Soyara is known to target point-of-sale (POS) devices, using a scraping technique that was first seen in the Dexter malware.
0.600841646323836 "We have seen several variants of Dexter in the past, so a new variant targeting specifically South Africa point-of-sales is not a surprise," commented Aviv, who together with Seculert researchers in late 2012 were the first security experts to discover and analyze Dexter .
0.1331206727293444 We've got Dexter, Project Hook, and other malware called VSkimmer ; and there are probably others that are out there right now," Wilson said
0.501320061314068 "We've got Dexter, Project Hook, and other malware called VSkimmer ; and there are probably others that are out there right now," Wilson said, later adding that threat actors will get a hold of sensitive card data any place they can.
0.561808096434716 Wilson said that the initial infections could be happening either via phishing emails luring victims to sites hosting Dexter or Project Hook, or the attackers are taking advantage of default credentials to access these systems remotely.
0.4006843399971423 A mobile security team known as HackApp posted to GitHub in the days before the breach a tool called iBrute that has the ability to take advantage of the Find My iPhobe flaw.
0.0980387901558833 A proof of concept attack, called iBrute, was posted to GitHub days before the attack; the poster reported yesterday that the vulnerability it exploited has now been patched by Apple.
0.680284917363086 As those interested in the initial attack method also searched for answers, one explanation that came forth was that celebs' personal photos, and in some cases videos, were accessed via an AppleID password cracking proof-of-concept, called "iBrute," which targets a weakness in Apple's "Find My iPhone" service on iCloud.
0.2486800830048405 Days before the breach, the team behind HackApp, an automated mobile application security audit tool, released iBrute, a tool that can be used to brute-force the Find My iPhone service.
0.213868549876042 "If a hacker can obtain a user's iCloud username and password with iBrute , he or she can log in to the victim's iCloud.com account to steal photos.
0.313784431045992 It's also possible that they have been using iBrute or a similar tool to get to the victims' - and not only celebrities' - Apple ID and password.
0.559921539518256 It's not entirely clear that iBrute was used in the attack, but the HackApp team said in a statement that it had nothing to do with the attack on Apple's iCloud service.
0.386861006821374 On the DefCon Russia website, the group stood by researchers ' claims, saying that it was "very unlikely that iBrute was used for this attack, but maybe evil guys found [the] same bug and used it," possibly through a different attack vector.
0.168441526240156 The company has not commented on the existence of the iBrute tool for brute-forcing Apple ID passwords, nor on the patching of the flaw that allowed it to work.
0.4157296125892173 The creators of the iBrute proof-of-concept tool -- which came out of a presenation by researchers at Chaos Constructions, a hacker conference in Russia -- said the tool used Find My iPhone's service API, which didn't include brute-force protection, was not the culprit behind the celeb breaches.
0.0492430304392333 The iBrute tool was released by HackApp a day before the incident, however, inciting researchers who discussed the PoC at DefCon Russia this weekend to defend themselves in an official statement on Monday.
0.669108119041191 A limited number of samples of the malware, dubbed Rombertik by researchers at Cisco Talos, were spotted at the start of the year.
0.705759615248735 According to Talos, the unpacked Rombertik sample is a mere 28KB while the packed version is over 1MB, meaning that "over 97 percent of the packed file is dedicated to making the file look legitimate by including 75 images and over 8000 functions that are never used".
0.345735470543645 According to the experts at Symantec, the Rombertik malware attempts to destroy the MBR to prevent unauthorized use of the Trojan.
0.2862809702830243 After completing this process and before begins spying on users, Rombertik runs a final check to make sure it is not being analyzed in memory.
0.389905401873446 But his case and the initial industry writeups on Rombertik are illustrative of a trend within the security industry that's become all-too-common: Threat reports that lack context - particularly on attribution that is so trivially discoverable, ThreatConnect observed.
0.48544232677580 However, he noted, it's possible more exploit kits will begin adopting Rombertik's evasion tactics, making defense even more difficult.
0.4730253411680770 However, if in the last stages of installation it gets a hint that someone is trying to analyze it, this initial goal is dropped, and the malware immediately begins to destroy the computer's hard disk by overwriting the Master Boot Record (click on the screenshot to enlarge it): "From the beginning, Rombertik incorporates several layers of obfuscation along with anti-analysis functionality," they explained.
0.726989196736870 However, unlike Dyre which was designed to target banking information, Rombertik collects information from all websites in an indiscriminate manner," the researchers noted.
0.500625408175671 If Rombertik detects someone tries to analyze it, it attempts to overwrite the device's MBR making it difficult to a forensics expert to access data.
0.751591513975864 Instead of simply self-destructing when analysis tools are detected, Rombertik attempts to destroy the device's master boot record (MBR), researchers wrote in a blog post .
0.3077593947451350 Last month, researchers at Cisco Talos, Symantec, and BlueCoat Labs were all digging into Rombertik (a.k.a. Carbon Grabber), malware that had, among other things, impressive anti-analysis capabilities -- it would destroy the master boot record if it detected it was being analyzed or debugged (or, as Symantec theorized, possibly if the Rombertik authors detected that their criminal customers were trying to exceed the permissions of their Rombertik licensing agreement).
0.771604024682311 On May 4th, Cisco's TALOS Group blogged about an interesting new malware sample they dubbed Rombertik .
0.573767076236040 Plus, instead of evading sandbox detection by sleeping for a certain amount of time and forcing the sandbox to time out, Rombertik writes a byte of random data to memory more than 900 million times.
0.330058026608331 Resuming, the feature implemented by the authors of the Rombertik malware has the primary intent to prevent the circulation of pirated copy of the malicious code.
0.250447112723440 Rombertik is the name of a high sophisticated strain of malware spotted by the researcher of the Cisco Talos Team, it wipes hard drive to prevent analysis.
0.625760567347856 Rombertik's disk wiping mechanism is aimed at pirates, not researchers.
0.0884976966303352 Security experts have uncovered new strain of malware dubbed Rombertik malware that implements high sophisticated evasion detection technique and analysis, it also includes the ability to delete victim's hard drive data and making the computer unusable.
0.2692798724016105 Some cybercriminals tried the reverse engineering of the malware in order to change the C&C address and use their control infrastructure avoiding to pay the authors of Rombertik.
0.657071042131454 The adversary using the stealthy Rombertik malware, wasn't nearly as stealthy.
0.337288024470976 The researchers said that the best defense against Rombertik is an adherence to security basics: up-to-date security software, avoiding attachments from unknown senders and solid security policies for businesses will all help avoid the malware, which is said to have low infection rates as things stand.
0.588816767393125 The Rombertik malware goes to extreme measures to avoid detection and cause damage to victims' computers.
0.4976042510125797 The ZIP file contains a SCR screensaver executable file that contains Rombertik, but icon leads victims to believe that the file is a PDF.
0.075775949170048 "There is a new kid on the block" and no one knows it, it's super secretive and takes measures to evade detection and analysis, and if needed will delete all the hard drive of the victim, and it is called Rombertik.".
0.653328117553733 ThreatConnect has conducted further investigations on the Rombertik malware and traced a malicious sample they analyzed to a Nigeria-based man.
0.448975136043276 To make actual analysis even more difficult, in the unpacked Rombertik sample used by Cisco more than 97 percent of the packed file dedicated to useless files, including 75 images and more than 8,000 functions that are never used.
0.1114339612207321 Unlike others that sleep for a predetermined period of time before executing, Rombertik writes a byte of random data to memory 960 million times, Cisco said.
0.406516017129099 We've talked a bit about anti-analysis in our blog before, but Rombertik seems to be a little "overly-paranoid".
0.2198153967551533 According to his analysis, the easiest way to determine if badBIOS infected a computer was its inability to boot from a CD-ROM drive.

0.520744139332956 As far as I've seen, neither these researchers nor those looking at badBIOS have claimed that a machine can be infected through audio channels.
0.3184916695161661 As to how badBIOS-infected systems communicate, Ruiu has proposed the almost incredible theory that it must be using ultrasonic audio communications, that is by sending signals via a PC speaker of the transmitting system and the microphone of the receiving system.
0.4155565793309380 Derek and Keith discuss at length BadBIOS, how it might work and where we may see it or other malware move in the near future.
0.375723294608054 Derek Manky Talks BadBIOS and Cryptolocker - Network World Podcast.
0.61398814168828 "Everybody in security needs to follow @dragosr and watch his analysis of #badBIOS," Alex Stamos, one of the more trusted and sober security researchers, wrote in a tweet last week .
0.583940198164872 For more from Network World's "Security Threat Landscape" see Derek Manky Talks BadBIOS and Cryptolocker.
0.553305855825539 For most of the three years that Ruiu has been wrestling with badBIOS, its infection mechanism remained a mystery.
0.619546929954412 Further, BadBIOS can communicate with other BadBIOS infected hosts using high-frequency sound waves transmitted over the infected system's speakers and microphones.
0.381144945325359 He said he arrived at the theory about badBIOS's high-frequency networking capability after observing encrypted data packets being sent to and from an infected machine that had no obvious network connection with-but was in close proximity to-another badBIOS-infected computer.
0.1866071437866153 However, I would like to appreciate Dragos dedication about badBIOS research because this extraordinary concept was first introduced by him only.
0.67404426334427 However, if there is no evidence (which is the case with BadBIOS), you remain skeptical, and take no action.
0.706608830038091 "I could, if I spent a year, write a BIOS that does everything Dragos said badBIOS is doing.
0.321649960730502 Isolating secured networks or systems using air gaps is also dying, said Skoudis, who pointed to recent side-channel attacks such as the RSA Key Extraction via low bandwidth acoustics analysis -- sound -- in 2013 and badBIOS incidents last fall (real or not).
0.188263648434193 It has been stated that devices in the BadBIOS case are communicating across an air-gap with commodity PC audio hardware.
0.1451389626975271 It is pure speculation but badBIOS just looks too strange and over-engineered for commercial malware.
0.0820628171920048 It sounds like a tale from a book on urban legends but security expert Dragos Ruiu has spent the last three years documenting the behaviour of a malware phenomenon he now calls 'badBIOS' but might be better described using the words 'paranoia' or 'mind games'.
0.2465828823438028 Michael Hanspach, one of the researchers, along with colleague Michael Goetz, told Threatpost that there is no connection between their paper "On Covert Acoustical Mesh Networks in Air" and badBIOS.
0.645741537251556 More probably given its age and the fact that badBIOS looks like the infector component of a larger programme, it is a fragment of a previously unknown state cyberweapon (a tell-tale sign if this is that it spreads via USB stick which means it is targeting isolated computers).
0.1242534080813099 "Really, everything Dragos reports is something that's easily within the capabilities of a lot of people," said Graham, who is CEO of penetration testing firm Errata Security. "I could, if I spent a year, write a BIOS that does everything Dragos said badBIOS is doing. To communicate over ultrahigh frequency sound waves between computers is really, really easy."
0.569327612149746 Recently, there's been reason for pause in that thinking, starting with the speculation and skepticism over badBIOS , malware that allegedly can not only cross platforms, but can infect air-gapped machines using sound waves.
0.3478130027561634 "\u2026speculation and skepticism over badBIOS, malware that allegedly can not only cross platforms, but can infect air-gapped machines using sound waves.
0.523859299871757 The ability to leap over "air gaps" - a term for when an infected machine is isolated from the network - is only one of BadBIOS's superpowers, Ruiu claims.
0.735495872595021 The controversy over the legitimacy of badBIOS did little to dissuade researchers from MITRE and Intel from coming to Vancouver and explaining how an attacker gaining access at this level of system architecture might as well take up permanent residency on a computer.
0.511240964503895 This article , recently published in the Journal of Communications, adds another log to the BadBIOS fire.
0.637415956069230 This ensures that it remains hidden from anti-virus defenses, and persistent through both reboots and reformats - similar, in fact, to the elusive so-called BadBIOS infection affecting security researcher Dragos Ruiu.
0.3421998770044859 While Drago Ruiu labors away in his security laboratory studying badBIOS and other security threats, some wonder whether badBIOS even exists.
0.476147642048483 While the possibilities presented in this paper and by badBIOS might seem outlandish, they are new areas of research that defenders have not considered in policies or preventative technology.
0.779535083013046 With an attack approach they've dubbed BadUSB (after BadBIOS ), Jakob Lell, security researcher at SRLabs in Berlin, and independent security researcher Karsten Nohl, threw USB security and just about everything USB-related (including your computer with USB ports in it) into a profoundly untrustworthy state as a result of their presentation at the Black Hat USA 2014 conference in Las Vegas.
0.1928721644938198 24 June 2013 A fresh ransomware scheme is plaguing Android users by way of the well-known FakeAV malware, which has now made the leap from computers to mobile devices.

0.3070092385596072 This recent spam run is no different from how cybercriminals leveraged the iPad launch in January, which led to a FAKEAV variant.
0.059496772285112 This sad event, unfortunately, paved the way for cybercriminals to distribute another FAKEAV variant.
0.3774233131886920 This step is analogous to offers to purchase a product for FAKEAV malware.

0.163648598408656 Using FakeAV tactics was in vogue some years ago, but it seems that not all of them disappeared, and the last post on http://blog.0x3a.com proves exactly that.
0.447238110954222 Using tragedies, calamities, and other newsworthy incidents to propagate FAKEAV variants is no longer new.
0.746647948826523 We at Trend Micro, are keen to help users identify these FAKEAV scams before they can be affected by them.
0.3867867697629785 We have classified them into three categories: primary botnets (in Turquoise), which comprise CUTWAIL, BREDO, SASFIS, and KOOBFACE; secondary botnets (in Red), comprising ZEUS, TDSS, and WALEDAC; and tertiary botnets (in Blue), which comprises FAKEAV.

0.2272588088839917 While right now the greatest threat that FakeAV on Android poses is the cost you pay to download it, it's only a matter of time before great, more malicious FakeAV threats come to Android.
0.506804111982794 While the behavior of these new variants remained largely identical to previous variants, the amount of effort that went to create user interfaces (UIs) that look legitimate was considerable: In the face of all these threats, however, the best practices for avoiding FAKEAV remain the same.
0.639438050806210 While this particular attack involved only FAKEAV, the particular sites used change on a daily basis.
0.3763071556143887 With the continued proliferation of blackhat SEO attacks leading to FAKEAV, it is apparent that cybercriminals intend to continue riding on top web searches.
0.723566545545287 With the large revenue to be earned by the authors of such malware Sophos expects that more and more FakeAV trickery will be discovered in the near future.

0.1372412447083042 While DERP suggests that the group is using Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) which is a well-known DDoS attack tool used in various attacks (e.g.: Operation PayBack), and while it is a fair to assume that DERP uses a number bots for the attacks, the exact attack tools being used are not clear.
0.752059808231996 While some in the group continued to try to get enthusiastic followers ( or unwary webpage visitors ) to use a Web browser version of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon attack tool, use of LOIC had led to the arrests of members of Anonymous and LulzSec last summer .

0.1866388214405367 According to the US Department of Justice, Akbar operates a company called InvoCode, which sold the StealthGenie spyware app online that can intercept communications to and from mobile phones including Apple, Google, and BlackBerry devices.
0.755865666410908 Hammad Akbar was the CEO of a company that made a software called StealthGenie, and was charged with "selling and advertising wiretapping equipment.".
0.704609729148499 He was also ordered to turn over the source code for StealthGenie to the government.
0.534457773172798 If you're in the process of breaking up with a partner, or you are in a relationship with someone prone to jealousy, they may find it all too tempting to illegally install an app like StealthGenie onto your mobile phone while your back is turned.
0.601982112922902 Last month, the Chief Executive Officer of StealthGenie, one of the apps that Nyunt allegedly used to wiretap a police officer, was arrested and charged with illegally marketing his app to monitor adults.
0.622657235821307 Leslie Caldwell, Assistant Attorney General of the US Justice Department's Criminal Division, doesn't mince his words about the scourge of apps like StealthGenie:
0.3682758823278280 NPR named several companies that sell these spyware applications: mSpy, PhoneSheriff, MobiStealth, and StealthGenie.
0.1078372460715163 On pleading guilty he was forced to pay the fine and forfeit the StealthGenie source code.
0.2441254079074186 Recently, 31-year-old Hammad Akbar, CEO of InvoCode Pvt Ltd, which sells StealthGenie, was indicted for creating the software that targeted iPhone, Blackberry, and Android devices.
0.767571121079294 StealthGenie, again, is the perfect example: its CEO was recently arrested by the F.B.I. for the advertisement and sale of a mobile device spyware app that could "monitor calls, texts, videos and other communications on mobile phones without detection," according to a Department of Justice press release .
0.1688062251677144 StealthGenie spyware application, according to the law enforcement agency, is able to:
0.4114201343995501 StealthGenie, the mobile spyware app that secretly monitored calls, texts and videos on mobile phones
0.599750689177745 That bizarre nature and poor production value must have been in mind when the makers of StealthGenie commissioned this advertisement .
0.0986099529456336 The chief executive officer of a mobile spyware maker is a Pakistani man collared 31-year-old Hammad Akbar , of Lahore, who was arrested over the weekend in Los Angeles for flogging StealthGenie spyware application and now faces a number of federal charges.
0.763554522479218 The company's business plan for the product focused on "the spousal cheat" market, which was expected to constitute 65 percent of the StealthGenie app purchasers, as the plan even spelled that out, stating that the target audience was cheating spouses and romantic partners.
0.245412660000619 The Department of Justice announced that the creator of StealthGenie, 31-year-old Danish citizen Hammad Akbar, had pleaded guilty to advertising and selling StealthGenie.
0.2044273214461267 The FBI noted that while the company advertised StealthGenie's use for "monitoring employees and loved ones such as children," the primary target audience was people who thought their partners were cheating.
0.702907892562059 The StealthGenie spyware was advertised as being "untraceable" and would probably be undetected by the vast majority of victims.
0.281187543065832 Unlike Akbar's StealthGenie and some other mobile spyware products, mSpy advertises that its product works even on non-jailbroken iPhones , giving users the ability to log the device holder's contacts, call logs, text messages, browser history, events and notes.
0.50811683533789 According to all indications we gathered from the malware analyses and the research, we are sure of the fact that attacks carried out with Uroburos are not targeting John Doe but high profile enterprises, nation states, intelligence agencies and similar targets.
0.2661876451815865 All of this adds up, in the opinion of G Data's report , to one conclusion - whoever was responsible for creating Uroburos wasn't the common-or-garden malware author.
0.492984293199410 Although computer security researchers have been quietly studying Turla for more than two years, public discussions of the threat only began after G Data published its report.
0.588486275513464 Analysis conducted by Symantec has found several technical connections between Wipbot and Turla which indicates the same group or larger organization wrote both pieces of code-and that group appears to carry out attacks during the UTC+4 time zone working hours.
0.149948460643453 At the end, the Uroburos main dropper has correctly loaded the DLL module in its address space.
0.530774102067792 Based on the technical details, file names, encryption and behavior of the malware, G Data experts see a connection between Uroburos and a cyber attack that was carried out on the US in 2008 - the same attackers are presumed to be behind those attacks and the rootkit that has just been discovered.
0.617270635854971 Because we have examined earlier PatchGuard bypasses, the 64-bit version of the Uroburos malware caught our attention.
0.2671502299045601 Between this and upcoming blog posts, we will go over 3 major features found in Uroburos, which are the:
0.0747496288732124 Both Turla and and Agent.btz have files with identical names, and Red October and Turla both use a file called "thumb.dd".
0.634468854012583 But what makes the Uroburos rootkit stand out from the crowd is that G Data's detailed report into the malware reveals that their researchers believe it to have been created by a country's intelligence agency, and drops some heavy hints that Russia are to blame.
0.1536457815890297 data captured by the keylogger, and the "system" file, which is the Uroburos configuration file.
0.61876329358384 Due to many technical details (file name, encryption keys, behavior and more details mentioned in this report), we assume that the group behind Uroburos is the same group that performed a cyberattack against the United States of America in 2008 with a malware called Agent.BTZ.
0.4446192773050595 During this research, Kaspersky Lab also noticed links between Turla and Agent.btz.
0.098059572079473 Earlier this year, Kaspersky Labs researches suggested Turla as Snake , which was built on the capabilities of Agent.Biz, the worm that came to the surface in 2008 when US Department of Defense sources claimed that its classified networks had been breached by an early version of the same virus, described by officials as the " worst breach of US military computers in history.
0.606775888079010 Following the report published earlier this month by G Data into the "Uroburos" spyware, which heavily hinted the malware could have been written by Russian intelligence, UK-based defence contractor BAE Systems has entered the fray with all guns blazing.
0.576411256437287 G Data has called the malware "Uroburos" after a corresponding name used in the source code, which is based on an ancient Greek symbol of a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.
0.182179711074056 G Data is careful not to specify that Uroburos was developed by the Russian intelligence services, but makes it clear that it believes so.
0.1008930738412595 Government sources in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland and Romania said Turla had not affected them directly.
0.2312532551633974 Hackers use Turla to establish a hidden foothold in infected networks from which they can search other computers, store stolen information, then transmit data back to their servers.
0.574286879993033 If the victim is interesting, they get upgraded to the Turla Carbon system.
0.634425930868708 In a technical paper entitled "Snake campaign & cyber espionage toolkit" , BAE says that it has uncovered details of a complex internet espionage campaign of which the Uroburos rootkit is only one part, and that has been in operation since at least 2005.
0.42296733070793 In addition, Agent.btz and Turla use the same XOR key to encrypt their log files:
0.077610573192022 In March, security firm G-Data and government contractor BAE Systems described one campaign using Turla, which they called Uroburos and Snake.
0.2470238090093783 In terms of infection vector, the group behind Turla has a two-pronged attack strategy that involves infecting victims through spearphishing emails and watering hole attacks.
0.680796033479745 In this brief analysis, we provided an overview of the architecture of the Uroburos rootkit.
0.1621800577775800 "It is no secret that Agent.btz used "thumb.dd" as a container file to collect information from infected systems and in addition, the XOR key used by the developers of Turla and Agent.btz to encrypt their log files was also published in 2008.
0.3158511075324188 It is present in the latest samples (dated 2013-2014), but according to some data the development of Turla began back in 2006 - before the earliest known variant of Agent.btz was created.
0.332717146908402 It's possible, but the facts can't prove it," Gostev said in his analysis of the Turla connection to other malware.
0.705316532660518 Jaime Blasco, director of AlienVault Labs, said that Turla was more of a "framework" for espionage than simply malware.
0.0644446058585932 Kaspersky Lab researchers have discovered a new piece of the puzzle called Turla (aka Snake, aka Uroburos ): the malware used by attackers does not come only in the Windows flavour, but in the Linux one as well.
0.62624940244164 One case in point is Snake (also known as Turla and Uroboros), a highly sophisticated malware that maintains persistent access using covert communications, some of which are very difficult to detect.
0.273655774410360 One current example is Snake, also known as Ouroboros and Uroburos, an espionage tool which has been detected in multiple instances in Ukraine and elsewhere.
0.526952663829386 Recently, security researchers from Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab have detected the first Turla sample targeting Linux operating system.
0.1347415008870447 Reports last week detailed the Turla malware's infection of networks belonging to U.S. government agencies as well as some targets in Ukraine, the U.K. and some other European countries.
0.253349032563815 Researchers at Kaspersky Lab have cracked the means by which the Turla APT campaign compromises its victims, using a precursor called Epic.
0.301065667120019 Researchers looking into the recently uncovered Turla, or Snake, cyber espionage campaign have discovered some similarities connecting it to older pieces of malware such as Agent.btz, the worm that several years ago infected U.S. military networks and eventually caused the Department of Defense to ban the use of USB drives.
0.3392530799690388 Row: "Uroburos: the snake rootkit" , technical analysis by deresz and tecamac
0.257432394813004 "Secondly, the XOR key used by developers of Turla and Agent.btz to encrypt their log files was also published in 2008.
0.3241107903060841 Security experts at Kaspersky Lab have detected the first strain of Turla malware that was designed to infect Linux system and so called Penquin Turla.
0.60577013559857 Security experts say stealthy Turla belongs to the same family as one of the most notorious pieces of spyware uncovered to date: Agent.BTZ.
0.610986412320308 Sophisticated Russian Malware 'SNAKE'  and 'Turla' targets Governments and Military Networks.
0.501226152935426 The Black Hat conference schedule no longer includes sessions on home insecurity and dissecting the Snake malware campaign.
0.564952068456830 The complexity and design of Uroburos attest to the malware being very complex and costly to develop.
0.0765801168112303 The complexity, sophistication, and targeting suggests that Uroburos has national intelligence resources behind its development.
0.797066810654969 The connection between Turla and Agent.btz is more direct, although not sufficiently so to conclude that the two programs have the same origin.
0.3245485211224301 The "Epic" operation serves as the first phase in a multi-stage infection of the Turla campaign.
0.495083464033616 The first part of the study is dedicated to ATPs, like Icefog and its Java counterpart; The Mask - an advanced and vast cyber-espionage campaign of unknown origins; then there is Turla (aka Snake or Uroburos), which has been linked to a notorious Agent.btz malware, active since 2007.
0.1242954853295329 The malware was a previously unknown piece of a government malware, Turla, considered by the experts one of the most complex APTs in the history.
0.1897546452909082 The modules of the Linux-based Turla malware is written in C and C++ languages and contains code from previously written libraries.
0.0715749316642363 The past few days has seen an extensive discussion within the IT security industry about a cyberespionage campaign called Turla, aka Snake and Uroburos, which, according to G-DATA experts, may have been created by Russian special services.
0.4207495521802362 The same webshell was observed in the operations of another APT - Turla, Snake or Uroburos ).
0.296147099264476 The second attack was against Ukraine and other nations, uncovered earlier this year, using malicious software dubbed "Snake" or "Uroburos".
0.151144066398515 The Uroburos rootkit takes its name from a mythical serpent or dragon that ate its own tail, and a sequence of characters concealed deep within the malware's code: Ur0bUr()sGotyOu#.
0.644451685709657 These new reports link the Snake malware (a rootkit) to Agent.BTZ, and lay out the way that the two Snake variants operate.
0.4804980662238703 This includes sophisticated attacks seemingly run by national intelligence agencies, using such spying tools as Regin and Flame, which many in the IT world suspect were created by the U.S.; Turla, a piece of malware that many blame on the Russian government; and a huge snooping effort called GhostNet, which spied on the Dalai Lama and Asian governments, leading many of my colleagues to blame China.
0.797632267686749 Turla also uses the same XOR key and log file names as Agent.btz, suggesting a strong link between the two.
0.38694148284661 Turla has some attributes that have led other security researchers to link it to another piece of malware, Agent.BTZ.
0.1454175102786656 Turla was already ranked as one of the top-tier APTs, in the same league as the recently disclosed Regin for instance.
0.2211268712900932 Turla was detected for the first time by researchers at BAE , which believe that the malware was developed by a Russian cyber specialists , probably all these instances are part of a cyber weapon program of the Government of Moscow.
0.314712760464741 Uroburos checks for the presence of Agent.BTZ and remains inactive if it is installed.
0.462638387290430 Uroburos steals files from infected computers and captures network traffic, and has some sophisticated tricks up its sleeve to help hackers exfiltrate information from targeted organisations.
0.508994137936771 We are as yet unable to determine at what point in time this particular key was adopted for Turla.
0.2722356406105399 We believe," it adds, "the team behind Uroburos has developed an even more sophisticated framework, which still remains undiscovered.".
0.3351047091073019 We believe that the team behind Uroburos has continued working on even more advanced variants, which are still to be discovered.
0.4714124487753388 We're still investigating Turla, which we believe is far more complex than is suggested by the materials that have been published so far.
0.584818370194787 When G-Data published on Turla/Uroburos back in February, several questions remained unanswered.
0.59867738891466 When G-Data published their Turla paper, there were few details publicly available on how victims get infected with this malware campaign.
0.2120369512080101 "Wipbot is used as a recon tool at some stage, and if the victim is believed to be of high interest, then Turla is delivered at that point," said Vikram Thakur, senior security researcher with Symantec. "We see a few technical similarities between the two that makes us believe that they are both developed by people either in the same building or are part of the same organization."
0.0877090932175813 With all of that detail known publicly, researchers say that there is not enough evidence to say conclusively that Turla is directly connected to Agent.btz or Red October.

0.336817235675396 We monitored the abovementioned URLs and found out that the FlashPack exploit kit is now using free ads to distribute malware such as ZeuS/ZBOT, DOFOIL, and ransomware variants.
0.3391603016585771 It might install spyware on the infected computer to harvest personal information or business documents, writes Rascagneres. It might also install banking Trojans to steal money or it might install any other form of harmful software that can suit the needs of the attackers. Fellow researchers have suggested that Poweliks is used in botnet structures and to generate immense revenue through ad-fraud.
0.1427737411650138 Upon infecting the host system, Poweliks exploits vulnerability in Microsoft Word, with the assistance of another specially designed (by hackers) malicious Word file that transmits via email.
0.3319930530729965 After a successful infection, the malware creates an encoded autostart key hidden in the Windows registry -- used to survive system reboots -- to store all of Poweliks' malicious code.
0.1597513520104725 As developers of security software constantly improve detection methods, malware creators are always trying to keep one step ahead of their efforts.Take, for example, the Poweliks malware recently discovered and analyzed by G Data researchers.

0.3344630893117680 In another twist, Kafeine discovered how the filess EK distributes Poweliks, a threat that is also fileless and uses the registry to achieve persistence:
0.450354247876471 Most notable was the discovery of Poweliks, a powerful Windows registry exploit, which was fully contained in the registry and did not require a file component to deliver a new infection such as crypto ransomware.
0.612001519376213 Multistage malware, such as Poweliks, and multistage attacks could give enterprises more time to detect the malware because each step takes time; however, each step might not necessarily need to be detected because the individual steps themselves might not be malicious.
0.4009894563642366 Next, Poweliks will search for Windows PowerShell on the infected machine, and if the software isn't present, the malware will download it.
0.437020457967182 Paul Rascagnères, senior threat researcher with Germany-based antivirus vendor G DATA Software AG, said in a blog post that Poweliks is noteworthy because it doesn't produce any files that can be analyzed by traditional AV products.

0.797985471246133 The malware analysts consider Poweliks a very complex code which use several code layers to hide itself from prying eyes, it is able to survive without any file creation and this circumstance makes it very insidious, he performs every operation in memory and maintain persistence through a smart use of the Windows registry.
0.531040367328043 The "Poweliks" malware, originally spotted by members of the KernelMode.info forum nearly three weeks ago, is reportedly being used as a persistent infection point from which attackers can repeatedly download more payloads onto a compromised machine even after reboots, though it is also capable of stealing system information to enable additional attacks.
0.481697175506296 The said tactic provides evasion and stealth mechanisms to the malware, which Trend Micro detects as TROJ_POWELIKS.A .
0.585857221484673 To implant Poweliks on a victim's machine, attackers must first trigger a separate vulnerability; the sample analyzed by Rascagnères employs the Microsoft Word flaw detailed in CVE-2012-0158 .
0.2926813310325111 A California woman is suing both Lenovo and Superfish , after the PC maker was found shipping laptops to consumers with Superfish adware pre-installed.
0.665330369016595 A proposed class-action suit was filed late last week against Lenovo and Superfish, which charges both companies with "fraudulent" business practices and of making Lenovo PCs vulnerable to malware and malicious attacks by pre-loading the adware.
0.714604209598171 A spokeswoman for Superfish confirmed that the company hired Komodia to provide some of the technology that hijacked HTTPS connections on Lenovo computers.
0.641791849679646 A visitor to a website can be tricked into downloading an unwanted software and programs that could result in a major security risk, just what happened in the recent Superfish incident.
0.668816276393037 According to Facebook's Richard, more than a dozen software applications other than Superfish use Komodia code.
0.60865861724 Adding insult to injury, Superfish does not seem to check whether or not the initial certificate (from Bank of America, or wherever) was, itself, legitimate.
0.3251563133268885 After the news became widely known, Lenovo published instructions on how to remove the software and apologized , but Superfish maintained that news reports amounted to "misinformation" and that Superfish adware "does not present a security risk," despite multiple researchers claiming the contrary.
0.184679172944444 After the Superfish debacle earlier this year, Lenovo's security practices have once again been found lacking as researchers have discovered several vulnerabilities in the company's System Update software.

0.733212346947935 And as you might guess it's also "infected" with PUP (a SuperFish Software (that's the one which displays ads on webpages)).
0.1416070051180864 As the Superfish saga has unfolded, with Lenovo apologizing and saying it "messed up," you might think the company would distance itself from bloatware and offer customers the choice of a "clean" install of Windows.
0.532524100296538 Browser vendors will likely add the Superfish root certificate to their blacklists, which would prevent it from being trusted by browsers even if it's not removed.
0.1102048255271295 But based on a graph the company published, it appears around 250,000 PCs had Superfish removed via the Microsoft-led effort.
0.3843911011455457 By analogy, Superfish uses the same private key across all clients, but in the case of the popular adware the root certificate appears be installed on more clients than those "behind the vulnerable DPI devices.".

0.552921963599993 Essentially, Superfish hijacks every SSL connection and operates as a man in the middle certification authority (CA).
0.2030148560162847 Expert Graham Cluley explained Superfish is "designed to intercept all encrypted connections, things it shouldn't be able to see.
0.319420376034805 Experts at Facebook have discovered at least ten more applications using the Komodia library that allows Superfish adware traffic hijacking capabilities.
0.531698542430393 Facebook found that more than a dozen other applications used the same third party SSL decryption library from Komodia that Superfish relies on "to modify the Windows networking stack and install a new root Certificate Authority (CA)," the company revealed Friday on its Protect the Graph security blog .

0.0787594232525121 Following on from the Superfish debacle the company found itself embroiled in earlier this month, PC maker Lenovo is promising to bring to an end to the practice of pre-loading crapware onto systems.
0.05538802712676449 Following on the Superfish debacle, he said Lenovo was demonstrating a "lamentable record for security.".
0.487579812096148 For businesses (or individuals) who buy business-grade systems, such as Lenovo's Think-branded systems, this never was an issue: The Superfish adware was only preinstalled on some of Lenovo's consumer laptop offerings.
0.0672721502105280 Furthermore, data security experts with knowledge of the pre-installed adware, called Superfish , revealed that the software leaves users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that break HTTPS security.
0.1090641147710589 Given Lenovo was heavily criticised for its security practices in light of Superfish, the apparent attacks by Lizard Squad, which infamously took out the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live at Christmas, will do nothing to improve its reputation.
0.1504722272893297 He then went on to show how the certificate tampered with the HTTPS connection to a banking website, behavior that allowed Superfish to collect all data unecrypted.
0.252503626922735 "Heartbleed, LogJam, FREAK, Superfish and so many other examples reinforce that there's too much blind trust when it comes to SSL/TLS, certificates and trust.
0.2588734409065286 However, it won't prevent locally installed adware programs like Superfish or malware threats from displaying rogue ads on HTTPS websites opened in the local browser.

0.202663316083699 Imagine that you are a major global seller of laptop computers and that you were just caught preloading those machines with ultra-invasive adware that hijacks even fully encrypted Web sessions by using a self-signed root HTTPS certificate from a company called Superfish.
0.2192904207082557 In a Lenovo Group Ltd. forum post Jan. 23, 2015, Lenovo Social Media Services Program Manager Mark Hopkins wrote the Superfish Visual Discovery browser add-on that came preinstalled on consumer Lenovo products had been temporarily removed from systems until the company behind the add-on was able to release a fix.
0.1694954151771833 In February, problems were disclosed in pre-installed Superfish adware on Lenovo PCs and laptops when a researcher reported that he had cracked the password protecting the digital certificate shipped with Superfish , putting encrypted communication at risk via man-in-the-middle attacks.
0.201991021039322 In January, a Lenovo admin tried to calm users concerns by posting that the Superfish Visual Discovery browser add-on had been " temporarily removed " from consumer systems, and that the company had requested that Superfish push an auto-update for consumers who already received computers installed with the software.
0.647392457329312 In January, Lenovo discontinued preloading Superfish onto consumer laptops as well as disabling the connections to servers it used.
0.652465703307336 In layman's terms this means that Superfish can generate any certificate it wants, which will be trusted by your browser as entirely legitimate, allowing it to impersonate any destination on the internet.
0.608630333124781 In mid-2013, Superfish announced it had secured a $10 million Series D funding round, taking its total backing up to $20 million.
0.584545423842549 In one Apple Mac forum started in 2012 and continuing into the following year was full of complaints about a technology called Window Shopper, built by Superfish.
0.0583989205792120 In other words, Superfish has never been anywhere near my computer, but two websites told me I had a Superfish problem.
0.554794619003070 In the aftermath of Superfish, Lenovo vowed to eliminate all third-party bloatware from its PCs by the time Windows 10 rolls around.
0.0872282548704812 In the wake of last week's Lenovo's Superfish debacle , at least one person has filed a lawsuit against the computer manufacturer and its notorious software partner, and one class-action investigation has begun.
0.733904334446515 Indeed, most members of that forum had no idea just how the Superfish software had wormed its way onto their machines before irritating them with ads as they hovered over content.
0.409559913824123 Initially, the company said the Superfish ad-injector posed no threat, a position it quickly reversed.
0.1619367257355247 It also released detailed instructions for removing the adware, as well as determining if the risky Superfish digital certificate is installed, and how to remove it.
0.4987182023665559 It appears that Lizard Squad hacking group is responsible for the cyber attack against Lenovo and it could be in retaliation to the Superfish malware incident.
0.529423041177689 It has already published instructions for how users can remove Superfish, and it will soon release a clean-up tool that will uninstall the program and delete the root certificate it created.
0.368676844132367 It is important to note: Superfish is completely transparent in what our software does, and at no time were consumers vulnerable - we stand by this today.".
0.533590737647722 It recently came to light that an adware program called "Superfish" contains a security flaw that allows hackers to impersonate shopping, banking, or other websites.
0.55915928877388 Its been just under three weeks since February 19th, when Lenovo became entangled in a web of controversy over its preinstallation of Superfish's Visual Search adware on some of its popular consumer laptops during last year's holiday shopping season.
0.40728970877589 It's starting to look like Superfish and other software containing the same HTTPS-breaking code library posed more than a merely theoretical danger to Internet users.
0.501818890740205 "It's the same root CA private-key for every computer. This means that hackers at your local cafe Wi-Fi hotspot, or the NSA eavesdropping on the internet, can use that private-key to likewise intercept all SSL [encrypted] connections from SuperFish users," said Graham.
0.18202891330505 Kandek later advised security management to assess their exposure to Superfish, adware that turned out to be pre-installed on Lenovo PCs .
0.3577471155638990 Last week, PC maker Lenovo was called out for shipping laptops with adware, called "Superfish," pre-installed - an incident that led Facebook to investigate the larger issue of SSL-sniffing software being packaged as seemingly harmless applications to users.
0.637913845836367 LastPass has done similarly, and created a tool for checking if Superfish is running on your machine.).
0.57606138734827 Lenovo admitted that it was caught preloading a piece of adware that installed its own self-signing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) proxy service that hijacked HTTPS connections, the company also informed its customers that it had "stopped Superfish software at beginning in January" 2015.
0.0993141506989566 Lenovo admitted to pre-loading the Superfish adware on some consumer PCs, and unhappy customers are now dragging the company to court on the matter.
0.618656408069858 Lenovo also says that within the next week, the owner of any Lenovo laptops on which Superfish was preinstalled will get a free six-month subscription - or for existing customers, extension - to McAfee anti-virus software.
0.482665406961479 Lenovo confirmed that it is working with two of its partners, antivirus vendor McAfee and Windows-maker Microsoft, to automatically scrub or isolate Superfish and remove the certificate, for those customers who do not hear about its cleaning tool.
0.2289684938910182 Lenovo did not detail how McAfee or Microsoft might help disseminate the Superfish clean-up tool or assist in removing the application and certificate.
0.666312222340231 Lenovo, for example, confirmed that it had received payment from Superfish in return for preinstalling its adware, and security experts say such financial arrangements are common, and call into question any claims that such software gets preinstalled for consumers' benefit (see Time to Ban the 'Bloatware' ).
0.52099332960793 Lenovo found itself in hot water last week when researchers found that pre-installed adware from a company called Superfish was making users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by installing self-signed root HTTPS certificates that made it easy for Superfish (as well as low-skilled hackers) to intercept users' encrypted Web traffic.
0.1683304176394326 Lenovo has acknowledged that Superfish poses a security threat to customers, and has released a tool to eradicate the software.
0.310886896769834 Lenovo has said it is no longer shipping Superfish with PCs, and has released a tool to help remove the program.
0.675963766549662 Lenovo is desperately trying to fight the fire of negative publicity that has engulfed its decision to pre-install adware called Superfish onto a range of laptops without telling customers.
0.4104382974054804 Lenovo is in the storm one again, security experts discovered that the company is shipping laptops with Superfish malware , a malware that allows to steal web traffic using man-in-the-middle attacks.
0.308297379733820 Lenovo made a seriously bad decision putting Superfish on its machines, but the company is now making a serious effort to help customers remove it.
0.137974075046838 Lenovo published instructions for manually removing Superfish and its certificate, then followed that on Feb. 21 with an automated tool .
0.788214397671217 Lenovo rates the severity of the potential security threat as "high," and notes that while the software itself can be easily removed from any device, "the current uninstaller does not remove the Superfish root certificate."
0.04732845094954818 Like Superfish, PrivDog acts as a man-in-the-middle to hijack SSL communications, installs a trusted root certificate, and fails to certify legitimate SSL certificates from other sources.
0.4688667340464892 Like the Komodia proxy used in Superfish and other software, PrivDog blithely accepts rogue certificates that would normally trigger browser warnings.
0.666578771791184 "Likewise, the web page sent back by Bank of America might have advertisments inserted into the HTML by Superfish.".
0.2099655117363483 Lizard Squad showed off an email they lifted that referenced continuing problems with Superfish:
0.1881701141797398 Microsoft also blogged that on Feb. 19 it released an update to its Malicious Software Removal Tool which searches for and removes Superfish, an adware program that was recently discovered to have factory-shipped with many consumer PCs made by Lenovo .

0.1646117403594097 Microsoft, McAfee -- both Lenovo partners -- and Symantec have also issued anti-malware updates that scrub Superfish from PCs.
0.655065595022951 Microsoft today updated its free Windows Defender and Security Essentials antivirus programs with a signature that sniffs out and deletes the rogue certificate linked to Superfish Visual Discovery, the "crapware" that blew up in Lenovo's face this week.
0.2438965778533325 Microsoft's Windows Defender and McAfee's security applications also remove Superfish since Friday.
0.1660806068153414 More dangerously, some PuPs are full-blown malware, as was the case with the Superfish spyware that came pre-installed on Lenovo machines.
0.2964897873910543 Mozilla had been working on the hotfix since Feb. 18 , when news first broke about Superfish's vulnerability to abuse.
0.4624789548751614 My advice, if you have a Lenovo, is to go to this official Superfish Vulnerability page .
0.365405780129985 Nearly one month later, news broke that Superfish included a security vulnerability that made customers susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTPS sites.
0.760330576507317 Neither Lenovo nor Superfish would comment on the value of their partnership.
0.0644311680308784 "Normally the CA would have signed it," he continued, adding later that "Anyone could pretend to be Superfish," if they have a copy of the Superfish MitM private key.
0.2387407988405987 Now, I am not going to delve into the technical details of this adware since my colleague Stephen Cobb has discussed the Superfish adware in detail in this blog post , and ESET's knowledgebase team has done their usual excellent job here , so what I am going to do, instead, is take a look at Lenovo's response.
0.1239363468183912 Now, I fully understand the outrage over Lenovo shipping computers with broken security, and calling Superfish an ill-conceived piece of software as I did in my opening sentence is clearly an understatement; however, what is needed right now is a calm approach to fixing the immediate problem of insecure systems.
0.638847299090328 Now, thanks to Lenovo and Superfish Visual Discovery adware , we didn't merely get injected ads in our search engine results, we also had our computer doors opened to man-in-the-middle Secure-Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) attacks.
0.087599248096739 On Thursday, Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, revealed on his blog that he was able to extract the Superfish certificate via reverse engineering and crack the password encrypting it.
0.509731433419879 On top of undesirable ads being literally forced into your browser, Superfish also introduces major vulnerabilities because it uses a valid encryption certificate which has already been compromised .
0.0543566177231449 Palmer was later able to confirm that the private key for the Superfish certificate installed on his Yoga 2 contained the same private key as a Superfish certificate installed on a different person's Lenovo PC .

0.59440382207741 Plus, the Superfish certificate uses the SHA-1 algorithm -- so it may be trashing a stronger SHA-2 cert in favor of a weaker one.
0.4679087490315838 Regardless of the furore that's exploded online since the Lenovo revelations, and the intriguing history of Pinhas and his firm, Superfish is still earning a packet.
0.108536645245418 Researchers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) yesterday said that they had found evidence that implies attackers have exploited a security vulnerability in the Superfish adware and a slew of other programs.
0.616198283416977 Sean Sullivan, from anti-virus vendor F-Secure, told me over Twitter that Window Shopper was much more prevalent than the Lenovo-powered version of Superfish technology, though it didn't ostensibly open up the same security issues.
0.256885710139307 Security experts warn that Superfish adware leaves users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks via a self-signed root certificate, which could allow a saboteur to intercept users' encrypted SSL connections.

0.2792062021847 Superfish was previously included on some consumer notebook products shipped in a short window between September and December to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping.
0.3349169105923428 That meant a browser trusted all the fake certificates generated by Superfish, which was effectively conducting a classic "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) attack able to spy on supposedly secure traffic between a browser and a server.
0.627996472243814 That Superfish certificate then re-signed all certificates presented by domains using HTTPS.
0.344142840527676 The biggest fear from a security standpoint is that a criminal-minded hacker could use Superfish's encryption methods and abuse them to intercept other people's traffic.

0.401515213657804 The promise to go bloatware-free is just the latest in a series of mea culpas from Lenovo, after security experts discovered a serious vulnerability in pre-loaded software called Superfish .
0.643872638814051 The software, provided by a company called Superfish, gave attackers an inexpensive and easy way to spoof Bank of America, Google, or any other website on the Internet and would nonetheless be trusted by most Web browsers.
0.2421091879633102 The Superfish malware went bad to worse when Errata Security's Robert David Graham cracked and published the password that would allow anyone to unlock the certificate authority and bypass the computer's web encryption.
0.336171345714859 The Superfish removal tool comes few days after the story broke about the nasty Superfish malware that has capability to sneakily intercept and decrypt HTTPS connections, tamper with pages in an attempt to inject advertisements.
0.789967298085499 There are as many as a dozen variants of the Superfish bloatware found last week on Lenovo laptops, it has been discovered.
0.65050122377645 There are several places that the Superfish certificate can be installed.
0.544356500758286 This backfired on them and the backlash became so intense that Lenovo changed position and is now calling it the " Superfish vulnerability ".
0.434332106476608 This week it was reported that Comodo had been shipping PrivDog, an application developed by the company's founder that commits many of the same offenses as Superfish -- and under the guise of a tool that supposed to make Web browsing more private.
0.468059838639849 To battle the Superfish scourge, Microsoft added automated detection of the adware to its real-time protection products, such as Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials.
0.1536416464972910 To inject ads into other websites, including those that encrypted traffic, Superfish inserted its own SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, which proved woefully insecure.
0.731862094427123 To serve ads on encrypted websites, Superfish installed a self-signed root certificate into the Windows certificate store, as well as into Mozilla's certificate store for the Firefox browser and Thunderbird email client.
0.727445985166925 Today, the group took credit for hacking Lenovo.com, possibly because it was recently revealed that the computer maker was shipping the invasive Superfish adware with all new Lenovo notebook PCs (the company has since said Superfish is now disabled on all Lenovo products and that it will no longer pre-load the software).
0.1074390566296121 Two other patches address security issues that have received a great deal of media attention of late: The Superfish malware and the FREAK SSL vulnerability.
0.767905625650651 United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US-CERT ) also warned Friday that Superfish malware could be exploited to " allow a remote attacker to read all encrypted web browser traffic (HTTPS), successfully impersonate (spoof) any website, or perform other attacks on the affected system.
0.1566423439712899 User reports are now emerging online that PC manufacturer Lenovo is shipping certain versions of its consumer laptops with the software "Superfish Visual Discovery" preinstalled at the factory, and that this software has capabilities far beyond the simple "adware" that you may have (unfortunately) come to expect from some manufacturers out there.
0.609186023530936 Users have been complaining since September about the third-party program, called Superfish, which injects product recommendations into search results.
0.70707782857931 Using Lenovo's own restore image won't work, because that will probably reinstate Superfish anyway.
0.728860539827284 " We have temporarily removed Superfish from our consumer systems until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues.
0.313019158235118 "We ordered Superfish preloads to stop and had server connections shut down in January based on user complaints about the experience.
0.1219073774538578 Webroot threat researcher, Roy Tobin, argued that pre-installs of bloatware like Superfish are common practice in the industry and argued that this story should be a "wake-up call for consumers.".
0.2053921583875539 Westin and others argued that crapware poses security and privacy threats, something Superfish illustrated all too well.
0.796148467983960 What Lenovo didn't say was that Superfish was installing its own self-signed root certificate authority (CA) , This enabled the Superfish software to void SSL/TLS connections and gave hackers a hole to be used in man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and view the contents of any "encrypted" connections.
0.0961046557187715 What made Superfish more alarming, however, was that it was not securely designed.
0.3278810781564557 When a user visits an HTTPS website, the site certificate is signed and controlled by Superfish, so it is able to inject malvertisements and collect user information.
0.362252903629711 When the Lenovo news surfaced last week, security experts noted that the Superfish issue allowing man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks via a self-signed root certificate was so troubling, because it meant attackers could intercept encrypted SSL connections, and, ultimately, eavesdrop and steal or modify data belonging to users as they peruse webmail or sign into online banking, among other online activities.
0.695213397973428 When using Superfish for the first time, the user is presented the Terms of User and Privacy Policy, and has option not to accept these terms, i.e., Superfish is then disabled.
0.1308291201796106 While it's impossible to tell the impact of a specific tool -- whether Lenovo's, Microsoft's or others' -- on the Superfish infection numbers, the cumulative effort did suppress the adware.
0.516696565426953 While the company publicly apologized for the incident and said it had stopped preloading the adware, called Superfish, on its computers as of January, AG Jepsen said that there are still details the state should be aware of since the personal information of Connecticut consumers was "endangered," Jepsen said a Monday press release .
0.510583715834821 Whilst it's likely millions of PCs have Superfish Superfish running on their systems, intercepting their traffic, throwing adware on their computers and leaving users in danger of being hacked, many more will be running the technology believed to underpin the Superfish ad injection service.
0.562000755053166 Why this matters: Superfish was a nasty little piece of software that Lenovo pre-installed on machines to serve ads to users in their browsers.
0.708288420993117 With Superfish, it's been claimed Lenovo is using a self-signed certificate to appear as a trusted party (which it no doubt considers itself to be) along the chain.
0.234165512290289 With that, the task should be complete, and your system will no longer trust the bogus Superfish certificate, nor any sites or software abusing the certificate.
0.207559848037679 Working with McAfee, Microsoft and Trend Micro, the Superfish software has also been classified as malware and targeted for removal by their anti-virus engines, which Lenovo says will remotely wipe the adware from many systems (see Lenovo Hits 'Kill Switch' on Adware ).
0.725854646483067 Worse yet, data security experts warn that the pre-installed adware, called Superfish, leaves users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that break HTTPS security.
0.386749383030176 Yet, Superfish also installs its own certificate -- not approved by the OS or browser -- into the laptop's cert store -- meaning that the machine will always trust anything signed by Superfish.
0.615294589373236 You'll also want to download Lenovo's Superfish removal tool and run it just to be safe.
0.738373935194936 WireLurker is unlike anything we've ever seen in terms of Apple iOS and OS X malware, said Ryan Olson, Palo Alto Network's intelligence director.

0.05765239756900908 But when it comes to Trojanized Mac OS X applications, the WireLurker campaign "is the biggest in scale we have ever seen," Xiao says.
0.56103161744551 Dubbed WireLurker, it is the first known malware that can infect iPhones that have not been jailbroken.
0.4154535747781654 If WireLurker is found on any OS X computer, Palo Alto recommends the deletion of respective files and removal of applications reported by the script, and inspection of all iOS devices that have connected with that computer.
0.269062238424918 In a blog post, Palo Alto researcher Claud Xiao, who did most of work analyzing WireLurker for Mac OS X, said the Windows version is also plagued by some coding errors making it less successful than the Mac OS X variant.
0.437668109783196 In these days Apple the community has discovered that is vulnerable to WireLurker , a new strain of malware that is able to infect Apple iPhone and iPad syphoning user'data.
0.741841174387653 It's been almost two weeks since the WireLurker malware existence was revealed for the first time, and Chinese authorities have arrested three suspects who are allegedly the authors of the Mac- and iOS-based malware that may have infected as many as hundreds of thousands of Apple users.
0.3168634075386309 Let's remind that the WireLurker malware in a first stage infects a host (desktop or laptop), which downloaded the malicious software from the web, then it waits for an Apple device (i.e. iPhone or iPad) to be connected via USB.
0.409157142936046 Maiyadi is known for hosting pirated apps for Mac OS X and iOS and Palo Alto researchers found 467 apps for OS X infected with WireLurker; those apps have been downloaded more than 356,000 times.
0.399542858336091 Meanwhile the security experts analyze the WireLurker case, the disclosure of a new attack in the wild exploiting a vulnerability dubbed the Masque is attracting the interest of the experts.
0.672792177163380 More than 450 apps trojanized by WireLurker were uploaded to the store between April 30 and June 11, and were downloaded more than 350,000 times as of mid-October, the paper indicates, adding that the top downloaded malicious apps include The Sims 3, International Snooker 2012, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014, Bejeweled 3 and Angry Birds.
0.694048969909257 Palo Alto estimates that "almost all" of the Mac apps uploaded to Maiyadi between April 30 and June 11 were infected with WireLurker.
0.1215823482902523 Palo Alto intelligence director Ryan Olson, however said, that an update URL for an older iOS component of WireLurker is operational and being hosted on the Chinese Maiyadi App Store's webserver.
0.706757860439070 Researchers said initially that WireLurker is under active development, so it will likely change and it's impossible to say what its real purpose is at this point.
0.764476307309358 Security Experts at Palo Alto Networks have discovered a new variant of malware dubbed WireLurker that is infecting Apple mobile devices.
0.657881152677396 The 2014 malware countdown won't be complete without WireLurker malware which freaked out millions of Mac users earlier this year.
0.097762192568779 The Beijing Bureau of Public security has announced the arrest of three suspects charged with distributing the WireLurker malware through a popular Chinese third-party online app store.
0.216091782483656 The company provides more detail in a report entitled " WireLurker: A New Era in OS X and iOS Malware ".
0.3450029669616777 The experts at Palo Alto Networks expressed their concerns in the official blog post on the WireLurker malware:
0.1142471419868312 The following graph shows detections of the WireLurker malware made by expert at Kaspersky Lab on OSX.
0.307785209595696 The importance of WireLurker is not WireLurker specifically but that "the use of all these techniques...
0.4645040110310514 "The real issue is that the design of iOS' pairing mechanism allows for more sophisticated variants of this approach to easily be weaponized," wrote Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert who analyzed WireLurker, in an independent review of the Palo Alto Networks report.
0.76335605995717 The recently discovered WireLurker malware used a USB connection and enterprise permissions - typically utilized for creating custom corporate apps - to mine data from infected iPhones.
0.426100989625290 The second piece of malware, WireLurker, targets both OS and iOS systems and was first discovered in June.
0.427026627778883 The third version of WireLurker was able to "infect" non-jailbroken iOS devices with an app that was signed with an Apple enterprise provisioning certificate -- but it wasn't malware.
0.3807144828358408 The ultimate goal of the WireLurker attacks , which were limited to China, is unknown but the malware was capable of stealing system information and data stored on mobile devices.
0.684775732683207 The unprecedented WireLurker malware was first analyzed by Palo Alto Networks researchers, who discovered that the malware was initially aimed at OS X-running machines and PCs running Windows, but that its ultimate goal was to infect iOS devices via USB, and to exfiltrate a variety of data from them (even if they have not been jailbroken).
0.3491645688660527 The Windows variant opens a new vector for iOS users to be infected with WireLurker, but appears to have been less successful than its Mac OS X descendent."
0.566159173603086 Unlike most iPhone bug, WireLurker malware has ability to install even on non-jailbroken iOS devices because the malware authors have used enterprise certificates to sign the apps.
0.448577252047382 Version B appeared on May 7 and distributed through the WireLurker command and control infrastructure.
0.733021150555420 Virus Bulletin blog] I'm guessing that the current spike in views of this site is related to the media fuss about Wirelurker
0.1312618739616241 Virus-like 'WireLurker' malware targets Apple Mac and iOS devices.
0.656426992638669 "We analyzed and investigated the sample and have confirmed that it is an older version of WireLurker," Palo Alto researchers noted .
0.639840779819031 Wei said WireLurker, discovered by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, is the only in-the-wild attack exploiting the Masque vulnerability.
0.4837207324270822 While WireLurker was relatively benign and currently under wraps, with hundreds of thousands of infected in the wild, the potential for future damage is there.
0.4008585117604873 Wirelurker does not push malware onto affected, non-jailbrokem devices, only unwanted apps.
0.1143354915680734 WireLurker is a multi-pronged threat: it attacks and infects OS X-based Macs via compromised applications, and from there can infect any iPhone
0.63560334932833 "WireLurker is a prime example of how this is no longer a theoretical risk, but an active threat as seen in the wild.".
0.523918062974455 WireLurker is also notable in a few ways: Of known malware families distributed through trojanized and repackaged OS X applications, this is the biggest in scale to date, the firm said.
0.06423538818328 WireLurker is capable of stealing a variety of information from the mobile devices
0.4227914570038766 WireLurker is the first example of a non-jailbroken iOS device being infected.
0.0811925483018077 WireLurker was observed downloading a comic reader to non-jailbroken iOS devices that was signed by the certificate, Olson said.
0.4153736342641024 "WireLurker was used to trojanize 467 OS X applications in the Maiyadi App Store, a third-party Mac application store in China," Palo Alto Networks' researcher Claud Xiao said. "In the past six months, these 467 infected applications were downloaded over 356,104 times and may have impacted hundreds of thousands of users."
0.2978143488842891 Yesterday researchers said they discovered and disclosed to Apple, the vulnerability exploited by the WireLurker malware , which targeted iOS mobile devices via infections through USB connections to Mac OS X and Windows machines.
0.728369302330876 By infiltrating Torpig, the researchers were able to become flies on the wall that could watch infected users as they unwittingly handed over sensitive login credentials.
0.752683164249980 Distributed mainly by drive-by download, the Torpig (or Sinowal) Trojan packs quite a punch.
0.71137451897968 I won't talk about /adfasdfksjdfn/ Sinowal BH EK (while still reachable it's not in use anymore) neither the white/purple Cool EK which is blinking (and quite surely built on a leak of Cool EK Code) neither the /reveals/ or /news/ blackhole (except if i spot the groups after transition).
0.586983696073038 In these regions, huge numbers of computers are infected with bots that collect financial data: more than 70% of the Sinowal attacks, over 40% of the SpyEyes attacks, and approximately 25% of the Zbot (ZeuS) attacks targeted users living in these countries..
0.32874092623006 One other great illustration for both, was back in february/march 2012, the Sinowal/Torpig group hosting its custom Blackhole on infected nodes of its botnet and making it reachable via Fast-Flux && DGA (based on Twitter trends).
0.766537554033128 Sinowal (aka Torpig & Mebroot) generates a week-based domain and day-based domain which is also used as a failsafe.
0.4725838165159772 TDL and Sinowal were the first widespread, sophisticated threats to adopt bootkit infection techniques.
0.623521572687001 The botnet in question is controlled by Torpig (also known as Sinowal), a malware program that aims to gather personal and financial information from Windows users.
0.2349854431096116 The post Torpig Botnet Hijacking Reveals 70GB Of Stolen Data appeared first on Darknet - The Darkside .
0.4694090723998325 The privacy aspect would naturally appeal to the discerning cybercriminal, and Torpig talks this up in his underground advertising, which Maor published, translated from the original Russian: "We would like to introduce a unique product to you, a bot by the name of i2Ninja, and tell about its various advantages.
0.0573758260237171 The Torpig Trojan has had many variations over the years but in its most nefarious form it is silent until called.

0.2459540227456711 In 2014, we blocked one instance of an app uploaded to Google Play that exploited [the FakeID] vulnerability.
0.4272485616345258 One of the vulnerabilities tracked was "FakeID," a vulnerability in Android's verification of digital signatures, exposed by Jeff Forristal of Blue Box Security at the BlackHat conference in August.
0.246956089755109 The list of dark markets seized by law enforcement includes Alpaca, Black Market, Blue Sky, Bungee 54, CannabisUK, Cloud Nine, Dedope, Fake Real Plastic, FakeID, Farmer1, Fast Cash!, Flugsvamp, Golden Nugget, Hydra, Pablo Escobar Drugstore, Pandora, Pay Pal Center, Real Cards, Silk Road 2.0, Smokeables, Sol's Unified USD Counterfeit's, Super Note Counter, Tor Bazaar, Topix, The Green Machine, The Hidden Market and Zero Squad.
0.393989686437077 This vulnerability, dubbed as "FakeID," is involved with the checking of certificate signatures to prove the legitimacy of applications.
0.552542910618561 Vulnerabilities were also seen in Android-based devices with over 75% of Android users affected by both FakeID vulnerability and Android browser flaws.
0.338243189868947 Whether it's excessive permissions, fake (e.g., copycat) apps that claim to be from a trusted brand, or platform vulnerabilities like FakeID, it appears being paranoid about mobile might actually be healthy for security.

0.1561909407669085 A new spam attack disguised as invoice message notifications was recently seen spreading the UPATRE malware, that ultimately downloads its final payload- a BANKER malware related to the DYREZA/DYRE banking malware.
0.2319701797901526 "After authorities shut down Zeus, one of the most successful Trojan horse malwares, Dyre quickly took its place by simply adding encryption," the firm noted.
0.0631275283645781 Because security researchers find Upatre/Dyre malspam nearly every day, it's a bit tiresome to write about, and we sometimes gloss over the information when it comes our way.
0.288637858160259 CrowdStrike's annual Global Threat Intel Report pointed out that Dyreza takes a more simplistic approach to banking fraud, acting to intercept logins and perform malicious actions by acquiring the HTTP POST data from under banking SSL sessions.

0.4630907111145763 According to a blogpost penned by AlienVault researcher Alberto Ortega , Bitcoin joins online payment services Ukash, MoneyPak, and cashU as possible means of paying the roughly $300 ransom requested by CryptoLocker.
0.3105917670817225 As per many ransomware scams of this type, the note continued that he had to pay £100 to avoid prosecution - in this case to be made via electronic payment service Ukash.
0.0900179562583821 For example, in the US, Kovter uses the prepaid card MoneyPak, and Ukash and paysafecard outside the US.
0.0845599825921944 "If the victim browses the malware author's website, he is asked to pay $100 using 'Paysafecard' or 'Ukash'.
0.2292878408222899 In addition, investigators seized credit cards used to cash out the money that victims paid via Ukash, Paysafecard and MoneyPak vouchers, as well as around 200 credit cards which were used to withdraw €26 000 in cash prior to the arrests.
0.67466353501375 Other common payment methods for other ransomware variants include Ukash and MoneyPak.
0.473872078640106 " Payment of the ransom can generally be performed in Bitcoins, although some Cryptolocker variants also accept payment methods Ukash, CashU or, only in the US of A, in Money Pack prepaid cards which can only be bought with cash.

0.622582869450962 With targeted attacks like Flamer, they are by nature not prevalent and not spreading out in the field, Marcus said. It's not spreading like spam, it's very targeted, so we've only seen a handful of detections globally.
0.5572658502299 As widely reported elsewhere , the Flamer/sKyWIper malware has largely been attributed to yet another unknown APT actor, which appears to target various organizations in the Middle East.
0.624920322251991 CrySys Lab, a Hungarian security team, noticed that a complex threat it had been analyzing for weeks was clearly the same threat as Flamer.
0.373060715731536 Gauss bot masters have directed their zombies to connect to the Flame/SkyWiper CnC to take commands.
0.739247790448621 Last May The Iranian Computer Emergency Response Team (MAHER) detected a new targeted malware which hit the country, that has been named Flame , also known as Flamer or Skywiper, due the name of its main attack module.
0.388707193180542 One module in the malware has a string with a name that includes "wiper" as part of it, something that could point to a connection to the Wiper or Skywiper malware discovered earlier this year.
0.628545822397054 Previously Kaspersky found intriguing code similarities between Gauss and Flame, but this shift in its CnC confirms that the guys behind Gauss and Flame/SkyWiper are the same.
0.334967977270867 Symantec says Flamer, as it calls the malware , is likely the same threat recently described by the Iranian national computer emergency response team.
0.4482084782496723 We found publicly available reports from antispyware companies, and log files in public help forums that could indicate infections of early variants of Skywiper in Europe and Iran several years ago (for example, in March 2010).
0.53143915282986 When news of the Flame/SkyWiper malware hit the headlines last month, the world went into a frenzy.
0.4694251083542708 On the other hand, it may simply mean that the group was familiar enough with the modus operandi characteristic of SCADA sites to gamble on the likelihood that Stuxnet would hit enough poorly-defended, poorly-patched and poorly regulated PLCs to gain them the information and control they wanted.

0.68787985553059 A 2012 book and article authored by Sanger said Stuxnet was among the crowning achievements of "Olympic Games," a covert program jointly pursued by the US and Israel to curb Iran's attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
0.550937773306447 A criminal leak investigation into a top military official has stalled out of concern it could force US officials to confirm joint US-Israeli involvement behind the Stuxnet worm that targeted Iran's nuclear program, according to a media report published Wednesday.
0.571244738379992 A day after security Kaspersky Lab researchers detailed a state-sponsored hacking campaign with ties to Stuxnet , an online posting has been spotted in which one of the victims pleaded for help.
0.322741900551273 A power plant and other industries in southern Iran have been targeted by the Stuxnet computer worm , an Iranian civil defense official says.
0.427077398556932 A public exploit for the last remaining vulnerability was released in November Did the Stuxnet creators find their own 0-day vulnerabilities or did they buy them from the black market?
0.427749654706166 A retired U.S. Marine general may be the source of the public disclosure of Stuxnet, an easy-to-exploit Facebook vulnerability was unveiled, and other news around the security industry.
0.336137677514396 A rogue group is covertly collecting top-secret data with an infrastructure rivaling Flame and Stuxnet.
0.717142310022800 A security bulletin recently released by Microsoft addresses the LNK flaw that was exploited by Stuxnet and that we have wrongly considered patched since 2010.
0.1700716629924703 According to security firms that examined the code, initially discovered by an unnamed research group that shared the information with the vendors, the threat uses the Stuxnet code, proving the authors of the first-ever malware specifically created to invade industrial control systems, are back at it.
0.397312510037162 According to Stoner, this approach is crucial for network and security analysts in order to effectively defend networks from new level of threats and malicious activity such as Stuxnet.
0.744256728268453 According to the Business Insider, experts have assisted to an escalation of the Iranian Investment after the discovery of the Stuxnet virus, a cyber weapon designed to cause serious damage to Iranian nuclear program.
0.150506642066847 According to the company, power fingerprinting could have detected the notorious Stuxnet malware, which damaged the Iranian nuclear program.
0.369311787518944 According Yonhap news agency also the South Korea, inspired by Stuxnet , wants to create and use a cyber weapon, the plans are dated 2010 and were proposed to the Government on February 19th.
0.2224728807654 Accounting for 33 percent of exploit samples in 2014 is CVE-2010-2568, which was used as one of the infection vectors for Stuxnet.
0.173137198958026 "Actually, the similar type of usage of both exploits together in different computer worms, at around the same time, indicates that the [Equation] group and the Stuxnet developers are either the same or working closely together," the report states.
0.1608256218499791 Add to this the use of Realtek and JMicron certificates, and remember that Stuxnet's ultimate aim is to access Simatic WinCC SCADA systems.
0.0847386788339764 Additional news regarding Stuxnet is that Siemens, whose SIMATIC WinCC databases are targeted, has advised against changing their SCADA system's hardcoded password.
0.335161517845665 After 2009, the evolution of the Flame platform continued independently from Stuxnet, and Kaspersky researchers theorize that the work on the malicious programs was tasked to two independent developer teams, which they termed "Team F" (Flame) and "Team D" (for "Tilded," the Stuxnet program).
0.1130918061691498 After 2009, this resource 207 was actually removed from Stuxnet, and the Flame operation and the Stuxnet operation each went their separate ways.
0.1696521710210231 After analyzing more than 3,000 files of the worm, Symantec established that Stuxnet was distributed via five organizations , some of which were attacked twice - in 2009 and 2010.
0.2241087326100270 ALASTAIR MACGIBBON: If you go beyond a Stuxnet and start talking about large denial of service or shutting down of electricity or water grids in nations, then I don't think many nations would really draw too much differentiation between that and a physical or what they call in military terms a kinetic attack, actually you know attacking you with fighter planes or ships or something else.
0.748695974846581 Also, because security experts are publicly on the lookout for Stuxnet-like threats, it's unlikely that attackers would use the same kind of code or methods, he said.
0.2446453142239 Among the interesting questions weighed in the CBS report is whether Stuxnet could be qualified as a "successful" operation, and whether - even if it was - unleashing it was the right way to go.
0.7222354412232 Among the pages of this fascinating account of Khan's rise and the CIA's decades-long surveillance of his secretive network are some interesting tidbits that shed light on the possible origins of the Stuxnet worm.
0.505219044884270 An article and white-paper ( T o Kill a Centrifuge ), published by Ralph Langner last week intend to set the record straight and correct some misconceptions about Stuxnet.
0.254061124771989 An Iranian news agency has said that "malware worse than Stuxnet" may soon be unleashed, to "spy on and destroy the software structure of Iran's nuclear program.".
0.403968601716870 An IT security expert at security researchers such as Kaspersky Lab, which first reported the existence of Flame, in a blog posting says Flame and Stuxnet contain some of the same code, suggesting that both sets malware came from the same entity.
0.65164833382283 An unusually large Windows worm-about a 1000% larger than the typical computer worm, Stuxnet most likely spread through USB device.
0.655542481269090 And he sees a danger that, the longer Stuxnet's code remains in the wild , the more likely someone will adapt it for more malicious purposes.
0.3124089748934525 And in January of 2011, Russia's ambassador to NATO said that Stuxnet could cause a "new Chernobyl.".
0.0614263923538362 And, like Stuxnet, Flame was capable of spreading both by USB, and by exploiting vulnerable network file shares and printers.
0.777337050450567 And then, at some point, the development [of Stuxnet and Flame] went in two different directions.".
0.197963287454588 And while Stuxnet was clearly the work of a nation-state -- requiring vast resources and considerable intelligence -- future attacks on industrial control and other so-called "cyber-physical" systems may not be.
0.569826665950171 And, while Symantec said it can't confirm that the motors targeted by Stuxnet were being used for that purpose, the company "would be interested in hearing what other applications use frequency converter drives at these frequencies.".
0.0406226722973361 Anonymous attacks in concert with Stuxnet and very public attacks on RSA and a variety of other companies has made cyber security headline news.
0.075303225328692 Another earlier example is that of Stuxnet , a spy malware that reconfigures industrial systems.
0.3449970174538903 Another example is Stuxnet , which started life as a simple piece of malware that had a "low touch" vector for transmission and then branched out to attack SCADA systems\u2026and that's really ominous.
0.4420571564999079 Another interesting information on this version of Stuxnet is that he stopped to infect computers on July 4th, 200, few days before the version 1.001 was created.
0.205414627061539 Another option is that this was a corporate rival of Siemens, the vendor whose SCADA systems Stuxnet targets.
0.714684691412592 Arlen believes that attacks targeting high frequency trades are inevitable, in the same way that attacks on critical infrastructure like power generation plants were predicted long before the appearance of worms like Stuxnet.
0.4338227525717297 Ars Technica said that the case studies showed how and when cyberweapons would be used, and Woodward said the timings fit both the Stuxnet attack - which 'lay dormant' for 17 months - and Iran's response, "Iran may have responded to this attack by targeting the workstations of Aramco, an oil company in Saudi Arabia that supplied oil to the US.
0.608020489328637 "As a precursor for the versions of Stuxnet that could replicate through the network, it's possible that Fanny was used to map some of the future targets of Stuxnet.".
0.4884271930904320 As early as 2002, Borg predicted a Stuxnet-style attack was likely, telling the Economist in 2010 that Israel has long had the capability to develop such a cyber-weapon as a more effective means than military strikes to derail the Iranian nuclear program.
0.717573092399167 As has now been determined, Stuxnet was not contained to its target companies; the malware leaked out and spread within months of the first infections to organizations worldwide.
0.321824976541383 "As noted earlier, the capability of stealing information about STEP 7 projects from infected systems was of special interest to the creators of Stuxnet.".
0.620736414948944 As the Stuxnet attack in particular showed, it's also quite easy for cyberweapons intended for one specific target to get a little feisty and end up on neighboring systems or networks.
0.655651852934207 As we know, Stuxnet, in particular, escaped beyond its intended boundaries infecting tens of thousands of computers worldwide.
0.703847776015469 As we reported this year, the arrival of Stuxnet was a watershed in the security world.
0.566937254248834 Assuming the reports are true, it wouldn't be the first time websites have been blocked in Iran-Ars itself was blocked in October 2010 following coverage of the Stuxnet malware that targeted Iran.
0.1158460555675312 At any rate, even if South Korea manages to both create a cyberweapon on par with Stuxnet and to impose a cone of silence and/or confusion around its own potential whistleblowers, the country might well have to deal with their Stuxnet-like weapon's Stuxnet-like side effects.
0.741700391312710 "At least one aspect of what Stuxnet does is to take control of the process and to be able to do\u2026whatever the author or programmer wants it to do.
0.1529145122510002 At the Virus Bulletin Conference in September, researcher Liam O'Murchu revealed that Stuxnet targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs) by Siemens Inc. and probably disabled machinery connected to them.
0.137456554147937 Attackers don't need to write the next Stuxnet or other advanced piece of malware to hit their mark -- about 99 percent of attacks are based on incremental tweaks to existing malware and methods in their attacks, according to Websense, which published its new 2014 Threat Report today.
0.489762241086656 Attacks on critical infrastructure have been grabbing headlines for years now, long before sophisticated operations such as Stuxnet and Flame hit the scene.
0.2347659538136143 Baker pointed out as an example that an attack such as Stuxnet , which put a dent in Iran's nuclear program, exploited a weakness in the same programmable logic controllers running in power plants, refineries, water plants and other critical industries in the United States.
0.4940507060035630 Before the Stuxnet developers could execute such a technologically advanced surgical strike, they almost certainly needed espionage malware that gathered detailed data about the makeup of the plants and the equipment they used.
0.268111754588882 Below you can see a part of the schema: www.eset.com 45 4 Stuxnet Implementation This chapter covers the implementation aspects of the worm: namely, its user-mode and kernel-mode components.
0.3434211750820276 Beyond that, the NSA and other spy agencies may from time to time release malware along the likes of Flame and Stuxnet.

0.589080985215447 Both Stuxnet and Fanny were designed to penetrate "air-gapped" networks, or those isolated from the Internet, Kaspersky said.
0.4106876938102853 But a new exclusive from the New York Times breaks the Stuxnet story wide open, confirming oft-cited theories that it was a state-sponsored attack and pointing the finger at both the U.S. and Israel as the creators of the worm.
0.483622923517802 But, after the vulnerability was patched four months later, resource 207 lost its effectiveness, and was consequently dropped from later Stuxnet versions due to the addition of a new method of propagation (vulnerability MS10-046).
0.593881954087790 But again, other than the possible damage caused by Stuxnet, so far at least there's been nothing worse than a few websites being taken down or fiddled with, some useful but not critical systems in TV stations and banks being damaged.
0.727127046629155 But as cryptographer Nate Lawson observed more than two years ago , the mechanism Stuxnet used to protect unintended targets from destruction was surprisingly crude for an otherwise advanced cyberweapon developed by countries with almost unlimited budgets.
0.2722503844349357 But as Reuters pointed out in a recent report on what one top US cybersecurity official called "reckless" cyber behavior from nation states, the US's right to complain about other nations' cyber warfare might be questionable, given what is by now a widespread belief that the US and Israel were behind Stuxnet .
0.146781557361177 But even the highly sophisticated Stuxnet worm was eventually found out when it landed outside its target zone.
0.577941847029267 But even with all of the forensics work undertaken in the wake of Aurora, Stuxnet, and other skilled targeted attacks, plus the attention and awareness they have raised, these attacks represent only a small fraction of attacks that go undetected every day, security experts say.
0.0813262153591993 But in 2010, Stuxnet escaped Natanz, probably on someone's laptop; once connected to the outside Internet, it did what it was designed not to do: spread in public.
0.505070678428185 But in a Black Hat talk given Tuesday, security consultant Tom Parker delved into Stuxnet and concluded that the worm wasn't "all that."
0.456233084205516 But Langner isn't the only one to have analyzed the first (known) version of Stuxnet - Symantec researchers have also released a whitepaper on "Stuxnet 0.5", which was first detected in the wild in 2007 when someone submitted it to the VirusTotal malware scanning service, but at the time no-one knew what it did and how dangerous it was.
0.217749662487367 But now, considering the Stuxnet case, which uses a zero-day flaw, signed drivers, and targets Siemens SIMATIC WinCC databases\u2026 maybe the idea of a Virtual CD attack isn't so far fetched after all.
0.544415711765742 But roughly two weeks after news of Stuxnet first surfaced, researchers at Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab discovered that the Stuxnet worm also could spread using an unknown security flaw in the way Windows shares printer resources.
0.623189181470568 But the evening climaxed with announcements of the winners of "Lamest Vendor Response" (RSA after its SecurID breach ), "Epic 0wnage" ( Stuxnet ) and "Most Epic FAIL" ( Sony ).
0.3838736987801363 But there's another reason why Stuxnet is being examined with interest by the security community: It appears that the malware could be targeting Windows computers running Siemens SCADA software -- code that controls national critical infrastructure.
0.603617084695096 But they're finding considerably less success taking apart the Stuxnet cousin known as Gauss.
0.1206224004906444 But things changed rather quickly when word leaked out via a David Sanger piece in The New York Times that the U.S. and Israel actually did build Stuxnet.
0.4029696428447264 But this one particularly caught my attention because it plays on some common misconceptions that still remain among the status quo with regard to Stuxnet.
0.1935286849912629 But this time they used a cyberweapon, Stuxnet , and no one knew who did it until details were leaked years later.
0.3142096812000483 But we also learned that malware could be developed for destructive purposes, that the case of state-sponsored project or cyber weapon such as Stuxnet , but similar approach could be also persecuted by private companies against competitor business.
0.1474440351100091 But with the later Stuxnet variant, the attackers didn't seem to mind that much if the attack was discovered.
0.1848067469002441 Checking the logs, we discovered that the , an early module of Flame, was actually similar to 'resource 207' from Stuxnet.
0.534878475854165 "Checking the logs, we discovered that the Tocy.a, an early module of Flame, was actually similar to 'resource 207' from Stuxnet," Kaspersky Lab Expert Alexander Gostev wrote in Monday's blog post.
0.676474797114999 Colorado-based Webroot said the virus wasn't as complex or as stealthy as Stuxnet and was "a relatively easy threat to identify.".
0.79918212424856 Conficker was Stuxnet's "door-kicker": Quite simply, Stuxnet didn't need a "door kicker," especially not at the cost of tens of millions of Conficker infections.
0.325238268211326 Consequently, Stuxnet triggered an unregulated cyber arms races in which nation-states are the big players, developing malware to use against other nations or their own citizens.
0.789763552211919 Consider the earlier Stuxnet vulnerability: that was spread using one vulnerability in Windows shortcuts to easily run Windows shell code; a second vulnerability was used to gain administrator rights.
0.620875410365116 Contrary to much of the public reporting on Stuxnet, however, Langner said that the worm was not designed to destroy the Natanz facility, but rather to secretly and stealthily control the process and steer it into a virtual ditch.
0.502461948291177 Dasient also predicts a shift to more fully-realized cyber warfare, with a focus on government web sites: "While Stuxnet propagated via USB sticks, one can imagine that an efficient way to infect critical, government-run infrastructure would be to infect government web sites, which government employees access more often than casual visitors," the company said in its report.
0.717117026847995 Data Destruction - While targeted attacks are typically conducted for the purpose of espionage, they do sometimes have a destructive capacity (see, Stuxnet).

0.748861049515974 "Don't just think about [an attacker's] intention, think about worst-case scenarios," Kaspersky said during the panel discussion. "And not just with Stuxnet and attacks on SCADA systems, but things like Slammer that caused an Internet blackout in South Korea in 2003. It wasn't designed to do that; it was a small piece of malware. But it generated enough traffic that South Korea was disconnected for a weekend."

0.333133701455734 During my years in this industry I've seen multiple mysteries, but few of them have been as interesting as the case of Stuxnet.
0.296085696079494 "During the first weeks of our analysis, I had a hard time finding sleep, as long as we assumed that [Stuxnet] could have been the Russians," Langner said Wednesday. "That would have been a very uncomfortable thought because the capabilities that you see are so advanced. I think when I reached the conclusions that this must have been launched by the United States that added to my comfort-you're the good guys."
0.784859458992315 "Encrypting your payload so that only the intended target can decrypt it hides both the identity of the victim and the worm's purpose," Lawson recently told Ars. "If Gauss came after Stuxnet, it's clear the authors disliked the publicity its PLC [programmable logic controller] payload received and made an effort to hide it properly the second time."

0.359005600166308 Fifteen of the zero-days targeted fewer than 1,000 hosts, while the other three (Stuxnet and its variants; Conficker and its variants; and a Bloodhound Exploit) infected hundreds of thousands of machines before being detected.
0.230423944920700 Figure 1.3 - Header Information from ~wtr4141.tmp Version 9.0 of the linker indicated that attackers used MS Visual Studio 2008 for developing Stuxnet's components.

0.776898403752133 First widely recognized as a threat vector of rising severity following the discovery of the Stuxnet worm in 2010, and gaining greater distinction as a result of the Mandiant report into APT1 in February this year, APTs have firmly entered the security vernacular and have become a serious concern for enterprises - and rightly so.
0.479463664111409 Flame, along with Stuxnet, has been linked to a joint U.S.-Israel operation targeting certain machines in Middle East countries such as Iran, Sudan, Syria and Lebanon.
0.796528711319338 Flame , also first discovered by Kaspersky, is generally considered to have been developed by the same team that developed Stuxnet ; and Stuxnet is believed to have been developed jointly by the US and Israel.
0.638374042186448 Flame is huge: It's about 20 times larger than Stuxnet, the malware that infected Iranian nuclear centrifuges in 2010.
0.421360578941535 Flame was part of "Olympic Games," the same classified effort that spawned Stuxnet, Washington Post journalists Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller, and Julie Tate reported Tuesday.
0.250379587180140 For escalation of privilege, Fanny used a vulnerability patched by the Microsoft bulletin MS09-025, which was also used in one of the early versions of Stuxnet from 2009.
0.473594927436793 For example, it's been suggested that the Stuxnet worm used for attacks on certain SCADA installations was able to use Verisign certificates stolen from Jmicron and Realtek [21] because they were acquired in some way from Zeus, which is known to steal certificates [22].
0.153267818189680 For example, researchers at Symantec found that Stuxnet uses default passwords built into Siemens systems to gain access to and reprogram the SCADA systems' "programmable logic controllers" - mini-computers that can be programmed from a Windows system.
0.1327874046678790 For example, the infamous Stuxnet malware - apparently created as a state-sponsored project to delay Iran's nuclear ambitions - contained several components that were digitally signed with certificates that had been stolen from well-known companies.
0.541586079464614 For industrial control systems similar to those targeted by Stuxnet, it should serve as a huge wake-up call.

0.164010933642792 "For instance, India was heavily affected by Stuxnet , even though it was ostensibly directed at another target," he says. "Friendly countries need to find ways to alert and inform the other to prevent collateral damage."
0.3002650736048023 For instance that hapless piece of malicious highly targeted software that's now called Stuxnet showed, among other things, that ICS users just weren't ready for getting hit; they were, well, innocently 404 about the very possibility of malware slithering in.
0.3296878466374455 "For Stuxnet to be effective and penetrate the highly guarded installations where Iran was developing its nuclear program, the attackers had a tough dilemma to solve: how to sneak the malicious code into a place with no direct internet connections?"
0.762081216098692 Frantz's account of the CIA's efforts to derail budding nuclear programs in Libya and Iran over the last two decades dovetails with recent disclosures about the origins of the Stuxnet worm that suggest that critical intelligence that enabled the worm to manipulate programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used by Iran had come from the U.S. Frantz's discussion of the sabotage operation and his reference to the motivation to create Stuxnet comes at around the 17:00 minute mark in the interview.
0.4109538113554077 From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame.".
0.777475062019057 Further, reports citing Bumgarner's research go on to claim that when Conficker was released, its primary mission was to identify IT assets that were "strategic Iranian facilities" and mark them accordingly, presumably for later seed infections of Stuxnet.
0.797893922851227 Furthermore, if the military is already engaged in purely offensive cyber-attacks (consider Stuxnet and Edward Snowden's revelations of NSA hacking), then there is little doubt that it has the right and capability to engage in aggressive but defensive countermeasures.

0.0540872874176947 He has long claimed that the Stuxnet code used to compromise S7-417 PLCs proves Iran was the worm's target, though this was the first time Langner shared the details of his analysis with the public.

0.2232643083044667 While the average organization won't find itself involved in a high stakes botnet takedown, there are a few key takeaways from the Ramnit takedown that can be applied to any security program:
0.399588005837453 Proofpoint security researchers recently discovered Word document attachments spreading the Dridex banking Trojan in two separate, rapidly propagating phishing campaigns.
0.1085048729689271 The Dridex binary files can simply be attached to an email or, in this case, be downloaded and executed by running macros on Microsoft Office applications.
0.787953691441436 Let's start with the consideration that bad actor behind the Equation Group has developed a complete hacking platform, dubbed EquationDrug, that's able to produce selective agents to target specific platforms, process manipulation of targets, drivers and library loading and traffic hijacking .
0.729465473551154 FireEye found no evidence of the gang's connection to the Shamoon data-destruction attacks two years ago that appear to have been behind attacks on Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas.
0.1727583009361073 In August 2012, data-wiping malware was also infamously used against oil company Saudi Aramco , around the same time that similar malware, called Shamoon, struck the Middle East energy sector .
0.1013437684943537 Still, this is a problem that individual users are likely not to have, as the Shamoon attacks have been very limited and extremely targeted..
0.0778252896680828 The cyberattacks hit the Saudi Arabian state oil company Aramco and Qatari natural gas producer RasGas using a virus , known as Shamoon , which can spread through networked computers and ultimately wipes out files by overwriting them.
0.651797687736444 The following year, Shamoon, also attributed to Iran, was launched against gas companies based in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
0.553447257554855 Dubbed "Shamoon" due to a string of a folder name within the malware executable, the attack ends up with delivering destructive malware on the targeted computers that ends up making them unusable.
0.769124513410945 Shamoon not only destroyed data on the computers it infected but was able to infect and overwrite the master boot record , rendering the workstations useless.
0.32902494276338 While it still unknown whether the recent attacks against Saudi Aramco and RasGas were part of the so-called Shamoon attacks , the latter are continuing unabated, says Symantec..
0.1953421307377237 Another interesting point about this injection is that the malware displayed browser-side is very dynamic, but when active it is very similar to this one (a.k.a. - Nuclear Exploit Kit ): Malicious Iframes Targeting WordPress.

0.565612934566895 "As security professionals we spend a lot of our time looking for trouble and expecting the worse. And in 2014, there were lots of vulnerabilities and threats to be found such as Heartbleed, Regin and Operation Cleaver," explained Corey Nachreiner , WatchGuard's director of security strategy and research. "With so much noise in the market, we wanted to help security professionals focus in on what matters the most – and what doesn't. Hence, five predictions you need to prepare for in 2015, and five you don't."
0.381850317240136 From the Estonian DDoS attacks, to Stuxnet and Regin, and now (allegedly) the Sony Pictures breach, we've seen nation states launching offensive network attacks.
0.1231892674839123 Given this, it is important to analyze two aspects of my comment: first, the fact that Regin also implements a credential stealing functionality that allowed attackers to syphon login credentials for social networks, and this can be part of Intelligence information gathering, but also for online banking services.
0.4064039396580788 The Regin malware was part of a sophisticated attack that an enterprise must assess to determine if it needs to defend against those types of threats in the future.

0.0954855388800290 Respected security journalist Brian Krebs reported earlier this week that the crew behind CryptoLocker has softened their 72-hour deadline, likely because they were losing money on users that would pay, but could not figure out how to pay with Bitcoin or MoneyPak in the time allotted.
0.712389894913417 Facebook in a joint operation with the Greek Cyber Crime Division dismantled the Lecpetex botnet, which infected 250,000 Computers in different countries.
0.533886356207491 After isolating and analyzing the Trojan , researchers found segments of a key modeule that controlled Duqu's command and control function were written in an unknown programming language - something that Kaspersky Lab expert Igor Soumenkov described as an object oriented language, but one without references to C++ or any other high level programming or scripting language like C++, Objective C, Java or Python.
0.289037304281115 Describing the process that generated the drivers used by both Stuxnet and Duqu, Gostev wrote: "A few times a year the authors compile a new version of a driver file, creating a reference file.
0.268948056777932 However, the Duqu authors modified the underlying C code with a customized extension for combining object oriented programming with the older C language - a variant sometimes termed "OO C.".
0.719019171109464 "Since the connection between Flame and Stuxnet/Duqu has already been revealed , it can be concluded that all these advanced threats come from the same cyber-warfare factory," Gostev said..
0.770400891262847 Targeted attack looks a lot like conventional spyware, but with some major twists -- and questions about links to Stuxnet, Duqu.
0.0856025853162034 The attack has also been recognised by fellow security provider Symantec which says that that it has also found evidence that Duqu has been used in a number of different attack campaigns against a limited number of selected targets including a European telecoms operator, a North African telecoms operator and a South East Asian electronic equipment manufacturer.
0.736937223392227 The discovery of the intrusion was casual, Kaspersky discovered Duqu 2.0 while testing a new technology designed to detect advanced persistent threats.
0.0823338617168033 The Duqu actors also grew much more ambitious, infecting an estimated 100 or so targets, about twice as many as were hit by the 2011 version.

0.0968209808125508 Among the latter are the masters of the Cutwail / Pushdo botnet, one of the most long-lived ones around, and their decision must be working well for them as despite several past takedown attempts it is still going strong.
0.433205776703518 Brett Stone-Gross of Dell SecureWorks has excellent analysis of Android malware being distributed via the Cutwail spam botnet .
0.689370055212537 But the Cutwail analysis gives a snapshot of how much money is involved in a large-scale operation.
0.41835383506193 For many years, Cutwail has been among the top three most prolific spam botnets.
0.75025004534091 Last year, our researchers looked into the activities of the Pushdo/Cutwail botnet and released their findings in the paper "A Study of the Pushdo/Cutwail Botnet.".
0.575745040935183 Row: 8  8, 95.168.181.236  95.168.181.236, RUSTELEKOM LLC  RUSTELEKOM LLC, RUSSIA  RUSSIA, Cutwail  Cutwail
0.536173387573368 The researchers at Last Line of Defense and UCSB distinguished between the two individual components of the botnet: Cutwail, which is the actual bot; and Pushdo, which is a separate Trojan that often is used to download Cutwail on compromised PCs.
0.206436364538308 Security experts at AlienVault discovered a series of watering hole attacks using the Scanbox reconnaissance Framework that is targeting several industries.
0.05521133647681930 According to security reporter Brian Krebs, ZeroAccess began its life cycle in 2009 as a delivery network for other malware-dropping paying customers' viruses and Trojans, including "scareware" fake antivirus packages-onto PCs it had successfully infected.
0.265372392579390 I discovered this technique while reversing a ZeroAccess Trojan (seems it's always ZeroAccess lately, right ?).
0.3835530379394478 It's not a new vector: Sirefef, which is a ZeroAccess variant, was also used in malicious Bing ads back in March 2013, the firm said.
0.3273234112164664 said Brett Stone-Gross , a security researcher with Dell SecureWorks who has studied ZeroAccess activity at length (PDF).
0.505710351909749 See Microsoft Teams With Law Enforcement, Disrupts ZeroAccess Botnet .].
0.3302924247078107 The malware the powers the botnet, also known as "ZAccess" and "Sirefef," is a complex threat that has evolved significantly since its inception in 2009.
0.661184672684998 The Sirefef botnet, also called ZeroAccess, uses a peer-to-peer infrastructure to allow hackers to target search engine results on Google, Bing and Yahoo, and downloading malicious malware onto infected systems.
0.567697708788457 ZeroAccess, which typically boasts some 1.9 million bots and has been in operation since at least 2011, is second in size only to Conficker, which although dormant is still spreading around the globe.
0.1527070332821939 It's an excellent analytical article which uncovers a very sophisticated and complex malware TDL-4 which is the latest version of TDSS.
0.664340695558621 A new report from the Conficker Working Group concludes that coordinated efforts to stomp out the botnet were a mixed bag: helping to thwart the worm's efforts to register Web domains that it used to spread, while failing to stamp out infections on Windows computers.
0.596509722169027 Fortunately the number of DOWNAD/Conficker infections decreased respect last quarter's from 509,000 to 345,000 of this quarter probably because users have upgraded their OSs.
0.1588901977105775 In January, ESET Latin America's Lab indicated that "Conficker came to stay for a while."
0.435837060565046 In the threat reports released every month by ESET, the Conficker worm has been the most detected malware in nine out of the 13 months of 2008-2009 that have already passed at the time of writing.
0.224738802812337 The fact that WORM_DOWNAD, also known as Conficker, is still the number 1 malware threat this quarter, a full 5 years after it burst on to the scene, shows that even old threats still have teeth.
0.1974376312272043 Rustock was knocked back a while ago and the Next-gen botnets were touted to replace it along with Srizbi .
0.697220416613051 But experts say the hackers behind Rustock have since shifted the botnet's resources toward other money-making activities, such as installing spyware and adware.
0.514618322108667 For example, the company notes that many PCs infected with Rustock were configured to wait for up to five days before spamming.
0.793294721787127 Researchers at FireEye have found that, whatever the reason, the gang behind Harnig has stopped downloading Rustock on infected machines, effectively giving up a source of income.
0.1584834393437981 The account suggests that Microsoft Corp. was the tip of the spear in the law enforcement action, sending attorneys in the company of cyber forensics experts and U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to take down the Rustock botnet command and control servers last week. .
0.077382931971833 The company believes upwards of a million computers may still be compromised by Rustock, which the software giant said often comes steeped in a "devil's brew" of between 16 and 20 other malicious programs.
0.784163188185922 We all know that the Rustock take down has decreased the volume of spam worldwide, but now Harnig's shutdown will have a significant impact on worldwide malware infection levels.
0.0687167021942589 We have now come across another piece of malware (which turns out to be part of the Andromeda botnet) compiled with AutoIt to execute its malicious code.
